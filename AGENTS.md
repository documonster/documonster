## Project Overview

**documonster** — zero-dependency TypeScript toolkit. Nine modules: Excel, Word, Formula, PDF, CSV, Markdown, XML, Archive, Stream.

- Zero runtime dependencies — never add packages to `dependencies`
- Cross-platform: Node.js 22+ and modern browsers
- ESM-only; CommonJS consumers load it through `require(esm)` (Node >= 22.13)

## Hard Rules

1. **No runtime dependencies.** All functionality must be self-contained.
2. **Prefer native APIs.** If a browser or Node.js built-in can do the job, use it instead of writing a custom implementation. Only roll your own when the native API is missing, insufficient, or unavailable on a target platform.
3. **No circular imports.** Enforced by `import/no-cycle`.
4. **Named exports only.** No default exports.
5. **Respect module dependency direction.** See layer diagram below. Never introduce upward dependencies.
6. **Run `pnpm check` then `pnpm format` before committing.**

## Bug Fixing & Code Changes

- **Fix root causes, not symptoms.** Trace every bug to its origin. Never patch over a problem — fix the underlying logic.
- **Read before writing.** Before modifying any file, read the surrounding code to understand context, patterns, and invariants. Do not assume — verify.
- **Match existing patterns.** Follow the conventions already present in the file and module. When unsure, search for similar code in the codebase first.
- **No speculative code.** If you are uncertain about an API, type, or behavior, look it up in the source. Do not guess.
- **Fix it properly.** If the correct fix requires changing multiple files, refactoring a helper, or adjusting an interface — do it. Do not take shortcuts to minimize the diff. The goal is the best solution, not the smallest patch.
- **Do not be afraid of large changes.** If the best solution means rewriting a function, restructuring a module, or breaking an existing API — do it. Correctness and quality come first. Tests exist to catch regressions; use them.
- **Do not touch unrelated files.** Only modify files directly relevant to the task. Never make drive-by changes to code you were not asked to work on.
- **Verify your fix.** After making changes, run the relevant tests or `pnpm check` to confirm the fix works. Never claim a problem is resolved without evidence.
- **No over-engineering.** Solve the actual problem, not a hypothetical general case. If unsure whether a design is over-engineered, summarize the tradeoffs and ask before proceeding.

## Workspace Layout

This is a pnpm workspace. The repository **root is the `documonster` package**
itself; `packages/*` holds satellites.

**Why satellites exist.** The core must have zero runtime dependencies (rule 1),
but some things genuinely need them — the MCP server needs the MCP SDK. A
satellite package keeps that dependency out of `documonster` entirely while the
code still lives in this repo, so a core API change and its MCP counterpart land
in one PR instead of drifting across two repositories.

**Satellite rules — machine-enforced by `scripts/verify-package-imports.ts`
(`pnpm verify:packages`, part of `pnpm check`):**

1. A satellite imports `documonster` **only through its published `exports` map**
   (`documonster/excel`, `documonster/csv`, …). Internal aliases (`@excel/*`,
   `@utils/*`) and relative reaches into `../../src` are build failures. This
   makes every satellite an honest consumer of the public API — and a real check
   on whether that API is sufficient.
2. A satellite is node-only and ESM-only. It does not participate in the core's
   IIFE build matrix.
3. Satellites are excluded from the root `tsconfig.json` and the root
   `vitest.config.ts`; each carries its own.

**Consequence for the dev loop:** because satellites resolve the core through
`exports`, `dist/esm` + `dist/types` must exist before they will type-check.
Run `pnpm build:esm` once (not the full `pnpm build`), then iterate.

```bash
pnpm build:esm          # prerequisite: produces dist/esm + dist/types
pnpm verify:packages    # no internal imports (no build needed)
pnpm type:packages
pnpm test:packages
pnpm build:packages
```

**Watch out:** root `pnpm check` builds ESM/types first because type-aware lint
resolves `packages/*` through the public exports map; root tsc itself still
excludes satellites, whose dedicated type check runs under `pnpm test` and CI.
Root `pnpm test` (and its `test:all` alias) runs
everything in the required order (core node tests →
`build:esm` → package tests → browser tests; the browser step wipes `dist/`, so
package tests must precede it). `pnpm check` includes `verify:packages` because
that is a pure source scan; `type:packages` is left out because it needs a build,
and the pre-commit hook therefore runs it only when `dist/types` already exists.

**Releases — one version for the whole repository.** `@documonster/mcp` always
carries the same version as `documonster`. release-please tracks a single
package (`.`) and writes the new version into `packages/mcp/package.json` through
`extra-files`, so the two stay identical by construction — there is no second
manifest entry, no `mcp-v*` tag and no separate MCP changelog. MCP changes appear
in the root `CHANGELOG.md` like any other change, and a commit that only touches
`packages/mcp` still bumps the shared version.

That coupling is deliberate. `@documonster/mcp` depends on
`documonster: workspace:*`, which `pnpm publish` rewrites to an **exact** version
— so an MCP release that skipped a core release would leave MCP users pinned to
an old core forever. Releasing both together keeps that pin fresh. It also means
the core must reach npm first, which is why `publish-mcp` needs `publish` in
`.github/workflows/release.yml`.

Canaries follow the same rule. Both manifests receive the deterministic version
`<current>-canary.sha.<commit>`, then core publishes before MCP. The version must
not contain a timestamp: a retry after only one package published must reproduce
the same version so the idempotent checks can skip it and finish the pair.

**A scoped package needs `--access public` on the command line.** pnpm does not
apply `publishConfig.access`, and npm defaults a scoped package to restricted, so
`pnpm publish` prints `✅ Published` while the package stays invisible to
everyone but the owner — `documonster` is unscoped and never showed this. The
publish steps therefore pass `--access public`, and every verify step reads the
registry **unauthenticated**, because an authenticated read succeeds for a
restricted package and would hide the problem.

Do not try to give the satellite its own version line with the `linked-versions`
plugin: it skips any package whose component resolves to empty, and the core's
component is empty by design (`include-component-in-tag: false`, which is what
keeps the `v0.9.0` tag format instead of `documonster-v0.9.0`).

## Module Dependency Layers

```
Layer 5:  pdf      → excel (only excel-bridge.ts + word-chart-bridge.ts), word (only word-bridge.ts + word-chart-bridge.ts + word-layout-to-pdf.ts), draw, archive, utils
Layer 4:  excel, word → formula, draw, archive, xml, csv, markdown, stream, utils
Layer 3:  formula  → utils    (independent calc engine; no excel imports)
Layer 2:  csv, archive → stream, utils; mermaid → draw, utils
Layer 1:  xml, markdown, stream, draw → utils
Layer 0:  utils    (no module dependencies)
```

### The `draw` module

`draw` is the shared drawing engine. It owns a structured display list
(`DrawList`), the single walker that consumes it (`renderDrawList`), the abstract
backend interface (`DrawSurface`), an SVG serialiser and a rasteriser. A producer
that emits a `DrawList` therefore gets markup and pixels from `documonster/draw`
alone, and a PDF page from `documonster/pdf` — the claim below is testable from
outside the repository, not only inside it.

**Why it exists.** The renderers used to pass an _SVG string_ between themselves:
the chart engine serialised SVG, then the Node PNG fallback re-parsed it with a
regex scanner and the PDF importer parsed it again with a second, differently
capable parser. Each backend therefore had its own reading of every attribute,
and the same picture came out differently depending on which one you asked —
dashes disappeared, opacity was dropped, rotations mirrored, 8-digit colours were
read with the wrong byte order. A display list removes the round trip.

**The rule: one walker, many surfaces.** `renderDrawList` owns transform
composition, stroke/dash scaling and text rotation, and hands surfaces
**absolute, already-transformed** coordinates in a Y-down space. A surface never
implements a transform stack, so a new backend is a few dozen lines instead of a
parallel renderer. Adding a _producer_ (a chart type, a diagram engine) gets every
existing backend for free; adding a _backend_ serves every producer.

A surface lives with the engine when it needs nothing but the IR, and next to its
target when it draws onto something the engine cannot know about:

| Surface    | Location                     | Output                                                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| SVG        | `draw/svg.ts`                | Markup in the subset the rest of the library understands |
| Raster     | `draw/raster/surface.ts`     | RGBA pixels via `BasicRasterCanvas`                      |
| PDF vector | `pdf/render/draw-surface.ts` | Page operators; owns the Y flip                          |

The rasteriser used to live in `excel/chart/render/`, which was an accident of where
charts were written rather than a statement about what it does: it paints a display
list and knows nothing about a workbook. It sits in `draw/` now, alongside the glyph
rasteriser and the stroke font it needs, and `documonster/draw` exports it.

**It yields pixels, not a PNG.** Encoding one needs DEFLATE, which lives at Layer 2 in
`archive/`, and dragging that down into Layer 1 to return a file format would make
every consumer of the drawing engine pay for a compression library. The seam is
therefore at the image: `rasterizeToRgba` is the backend, and the encoder lives with
DEFLATE and CRC-32 in `archive/png.ts`, published as `encodePng` from
`documonster/archive` — a PNG is a DEFLATE stream plus CRC-32-checked chunks, so that is
where it belongs rather than in whichever module first wanted a picture. Pairing the two
is two lines, and a caller with a different encoder (a browser canvas, say) pairs the
pixels with that instead.

That placement was arrived at the second time. The encoder sat in `excel/utils/png.ts`
while both its callers were in `excel/`, with a note to move it down rather than copy it
a third time. What triggered the move was not a second internal caller but a public
entry: a consumer of `documonster/draw` or `documonster/mermaid` could obtain pixels and
had no way to encode them, while a chart consumer could — and publishing the encoder from
`documonster/excel` to close that gap would have been the wrong answer to the right
question. `excel/chart/render/draw-raster-png.ts` remains as the internal eight-line
`DrawList` → PNG convenience the chart and sparkline renderers use.

`createPdfDrawSurface` takes a `PdfDrawPage` — a structural interface naming the six
marks it puts down — rather than a `PdfPageBuilder`. The concrete builder also carries
annotations, form fields and a content stream, and naming it in a public signature
would publish all of them.

Because the Y flip lives in exactly one adapter, so does the fact that a
reflection reverses a rotation's sense — a bug each per-backend renderer
previously had to discover for itself.

**Clipping** is axis-aligned rectangles only (`DrawNode.group.clip`), authored in
the group's own space so it moves with `transform`. Every backend expresses that
exactly — SVG `clipPath`, PDF `q … W n … Q`, a scissor test in `setPixel` — and an
arbitrary clip path in a scanline rasteriser is a different order of problem. A
surface may omit `pushClip`/`popClip`, in which case the walker draws unclipped
rather than dropping the content.

**Primitives** are rect, ellipse, **sector**, line, polyline, path (move/line/cubic)
and text. A sector is first-class rather than lowered to a path because the three
backends do it three genuinely different ways and lowering upstream would make two
of them worse: SVG has arcs natively, PDF needs cubics, and the rasteriser tests
radius-and-angle per pixel for an exact edge. The old pipeline smuggled the
parameters past the SVG string in a `data-sector` attribute so the rasteriser
could recover them; modelling them removes that channel.

**Text measurement belongs here too.** A producer sizes its boxes around the text they
contain, so it has to measure before it can build a display list at all. `draw/text.ts`
expresses `@utils/text-measure` (Layer 0 — the glyph-advance tables, moved down from
`@excel/utils` where nothing below Layer 4 could reach them) in terms of `DrawTextStyle`,
and adds `wrapText`. Before that, measurement was reachable only through
`@excel/chart/shared/chart-utils`, which is Layer 4: anything sitting beside `draw` could
draw text but not measure it, and therefore could not lay anything out. That was the one
thing stopping a non-chart producer from being written against this engine.

Note the unit: `measureTextWidthPx` returns CSS pixels for a point size, while a display
list draws text at `style.size` units. `measureText` applies `POINTS_PER_PIXEL`; skipping
it over-reports every label by 4/3, which is how legends came out too wide and centred
titles sat left of centre.

**Deliberately absent**: element-level opacity, gradients and patterns. Opacity is
expressed as an alpha on each paint instead. That is _not_ identical to the SVG
`opacity` attribute, and it is worth being precise about the difference rather than
claiming an equivalence: element opacity composites the finished shape once, so a
stroke that overlaps its own fill is flattened first and then faded, whereas
per-paint alpha fades the fill and then blends the stroke over the result. The two
agree everywhere except the band where a translucent stroke covers its own fill.
For the region map's circles — a 1.5-unit white ring at `0.92` over a near-white
panel — that band is under a pixel wide and the channels differ by at most
15/255; the fill is bit-identical. Closing that gap properly means offscreen
compositing in every backend (a transparency group and a Form XObject in PDF, a
second buffer in the rasteriser), which is a large amount of machinery for a
sub-pixel seam, so the alpha is where it stays. Note that
`describeSvgGeometry` folds element opacity into both paints, so it cannot see this
difference — do not read a matching geometry hash as proof that compositing agrees.
Nothing produces gradients or patterns —
the chart engine already degrades gradient fills to a representative colour before
it reaches any renderer — so adding them would grow the IR and every surface
without changing a single output. Filters are the one exception, and they are
named for the single backend that can express them (`DrawList.svgDefs` +
`group.svgFilterId`): a DrawingML shadow has no counterpart in a content stream or
a scanline rasteriser, so the field says SVG in its name rather than pretending to
be portable. That mirrors what the per-backend renderers already did.

**Metadata that only one backend can carry does not enter the IR.** The region map
reports which path drew it — real TopoJSON, the built-in centroid preview, or the
hex-tile fallback — and that is the only way a caller learns whether their topology
actually matched their categories. It is a fact about a decision, not about geometry
or paint, so the SVG renderer attaches it as a `data-region-map-mode` attribute on a
wrapping `<g>` when it serialises, and the PDF path simply draws the nodes. Nothing
was added to `DrawNode` for it. Prefer that shape for any future SVG-only
annotation: decide it in the producer, attach it at the serialisation boundary.

### The `mermaid` module

`mermaid` is the first producer written _against_ the drawing engine rather than
alongside it, and it exists as much to test the claim as to draw diagrams: it
implements no backend, and gets SVG, pixels and a PDF page anyway.

Twenty-one diagram types, but far fewer layouts, because most of them are the same picture
in a different language. A state diagram, a class diagram, an ER diagram, a requirement
diagram and a C4 diagram are all a directed graph of boxes, so each is converted to the
flowchart form and laid out by the same ranking, ordering, straightening and routing; only
the boxes and the marks at the ends of the edges differ, which is the part that genuinely
differs. A box that sizes itself — a class compartment stack, a C4 element with its
technology line — hands the result to the layout through `measureNode`.

The rest are _not_ graphs and are not forced through that layout. A Gantt bar's position
comes from the calendar, a journey's dot from a score, a mind map's node from the height of
its own subtree, a commit from its lane and its ordinal. Each of those is a layout and a
renderer in one pass, which is honest about how little there is to lay out. What they share
is the theme, the primitives and — for the Gantt chart — the date arithmetic in
`parse/dates`, which is kept separate precisely so it can be tested as arithmetic rather
than through a picture: a bar in the wrong place is not an ugly chart, it is a wrong one.

Three passes, and keeping them apart is what makes the module tractable. The
parser turns text into a syntax tree that says nothing about geometry. The layout
turns that tree into coordinates — a layered ("Sugiyama") arrangement: rank,
order to reduce crossings, position, route. The renderer turns coordinates into a
`DrawList`. A caller can stop after any of them; `parseMermaid` and
`layoutFlowchart` are both public because inspecting the tree or re-using the
positions are real things to want.

**Nothing was added to the IR for it.** Every outline is a rect, an ellipse, a
closed polyline or a path. The case worth naming is the arrowhead: a marker is an
SVG concept with no counterpart in a content stream or a scanline rasteriser, so
the producer lowers it to a small filled triangle aimed along the last segment —
which is the same picture in all three backends and needed no new primitive. The
text baseline is the other one: the engine positions text by its baseline because
that is what every backend can honour, so vertical centring is arithmetic the
producer does (`BASELINE_SHIFT`), not a portable attribute it can ask for.

Two layout details are worth knowing before changing them, because both were
bugs first:

- **A rank is re-centred after its overlaps are resolved.** Pushing left to right
  until every pair clears the gap is one-directional and drags the whole rank
  right; the trunk of a diagram then visibly bends away from a fork, because the
  fork's children have been shoved sideways and their parent follows them.
  Translating the finished rank back by its mean displacement cannot re-introduce
  an overlap, since it moves every node equally.
- **A long edge is threaded, not routed round.** An edge spanning several ranks gets a
  chain of narrow dummy nodes, one per rank it crosses, so it takes part in the ordering
  like any other edge and is drawn straight through the lane that was left for it. Without
  them it has no say in how the ranks between its ends are arranged and has to be routed
  afterwards around whatever ended up in the way — which is why a diagram with several
  skip edges used to grow a bundle of lanes down its margin. Dummies are scaffolding: they
  steer the layout and are dropped before it is returned, and they are deliberately kept
  out of the straightening pass, or a chain threading past a trunk drags it sideways.
- **The ordering measures its own output.** Median sweeps, then a transpose pass that
  swaps adjacent pairs while that removes crossings, then keep whichever iteration
  actually counted fewest. A heuristic that does not measure what it produced has no
  reason to improve it, and the last sweep is regularly worse than one already passed
  through.
- **Every edge gets its own place on the borders it joins.** Bending at the midpoint of
  the flow axis makes an incoming edge arrive at the _centre_ of its target's leading
  edge whatever it came from, so a node with three parents collected three arrowheads on
  one pixel — and in a class diagram the marks that tell inheritance from composition
  landed on top of each other. Ports are ordered by where the other end sits, so the
  lines arrive in the order they left and do not cross on the way in.
- **An edge that runs backwards or skips a rank is routed around the outside.**
  Drawn straight it crosses whatever sits between its ends, and the piece that
  shows is the segment between two _other_ nodes — a cycle's back edge grew an
  arrowhead on a pair that had not asked for one.

Cross-backend agreement is enforced by
`src/modules/pdf/__tests__/draw-backend-parity.test.ts`: the same display list is
rendered to markup, pixels and PDF operators, and the geometry is asserted to
match modulo each backend's coordinate convention.

- Modules may only import from **lower** layers — never sideways or upward.
- **Sole exceptions**:
  - `pdf/excel-bridge.ts` may import from `@excel/`. No other file in `pdf/` may import `@excel/` except `pdf/word-chart-bridge.ts` (Word charts rendered by the Excel chart engine).
  - `pdf/word-bridge.ts`, `pdf/word-chart-bridge.ts`, and `pdf/word-layout-to-pdf.ts` may import from `@word/` (the Word→PDF bridge family). No other file in `pdf/` may.
  - `word/bridge/excel-bridge.ts` may import from `@excel/`. No other file in `word/` may.
  - `formula/` consumes immutable snapshots and emits writeback plans; `excel/` owns the host adapter. `formula/` never imports concrete types from `@excel/*`.
- `utils/` must never import from any module.

These rules are **machine-enforced** by `scripts/verify-layers.ts` (run via `pnpm verify:layers`, included in `pnpm check`). It scans every production `.ts` import and fails on any forbidden cross-module import. A new bridge file that legitimately needs a cross-module import must be registered in that script's `EXCEPTIONS` map and documented above.

## Path Aliases

`@excel/*`, `@word/*`, `@formula/*`, `@pdf/*`, `@csv/*`, `@markdown/*`, `@xml/*`, `@archive/*`, `@stream/*`, `@draw/*` → `./src/modules/<name>/*`
`@utils/*` → `./src/utils/*` | `@test/*` → `./src/test/*`

Use aliases for **all** module imports — both cross-module (`@archive/...` from excel) and same-module (`@excel/cell` from within excel). This matches the IDE auto-import setting (`importModuleSpecifier: "non-relative"`) and keeps imports stable when files move. The only exception is `src/utils/` (Layer 0), whose internal files use relative paths (`./errors`, `./glob`).

## Platform Variants (`*.browser.ts`)

A module gets a `*.browser.ts` sibling when its Node form cannot work in a browser, or
must not ship there. **Write the Node name at the import site and nothing else** —
`import { readFileIfExists } from "@utils/fs"`. Selecting the variant is not your job and
not the compiler's; it is resolution.

`scripts/link-platform-variants.ts` runs after `fix-esm-imports.ts` and rewrites every
emitted import of a variant-having module to `#platform/<path>`. One wildcard entry in the
manifest expresses the choice:

```json
"imports": {
  "#platform/*": {
    "browser": { "types": "./dist/types/*.browser.d.ts", "default": "./dist/esm/*.browser.js" },
    "default": { "types": "./dist/types/*.d.ts",         "default": "./dist/esm/*.js" }
  }
}
```

So **adding a variant needs no manifest edit, no build-target edit and no source edit
beyond the file itself.** The wildcard is deliberate: an explicit list of 27 entries is a
list that drifts from the tree it describes.

**This replaced a second build of the whole tree.** `tsconfig.browser.json` used to compile
`src` again into `dist/browser`, and `fix-browser-imports.ts` walked that copy rewriting
relative specifiers to prefer the `.browser` sibling — its own log line was
`modified 112 files; rewrote 158 specifiers`. Comparing the trees file by file, 705 of 784
`.js` were byte-identical to `dist/esm` and 751 of 784 `.d.ts` to `dist/types`, and nothing
existed in `dist/browser` that was not already in `dist/esm`: `tsc` compiles the
`.browser.ts` files into both. It was 12.6 MB of published artifact to change 158 strings.
The files that genuinely differed were mostly not platform code but _importers_ whose
specifier had been rewritten — and an importer of `#platform/utils/fs` is byte-identical in
both worlds, which is why the difference collapses to the 27 variant files.

Two invariants keep it honest, and both fail loudly rather than degrade:

- `pnpm verify:browser-stubs` scans `dist/esm` and `dist/types` for a _relative_ import of
  a module that has a variant. Any hit means the browser condition cannot fire for it, so a
  browser consumer silently receives the Node module. Without the linker it reports all 158.
  It also holds a short policy list of modules that must keep a variant, because a deleted
  variant leaves nothing for a structural check to call a violation.
- `pnpm build:verify:browser` type-checks the browser declarations with
  `--customConditions browser --lib ESNext,DOM` and no Node types available. Drop the
  condition and it fails on `Buffer` and `node:stream`, which is how you know the check is
  doing work rather than passing vacuously.

**One capability was deliberately given up:** `dist/esm` is no longer loadable in a browser
straight from a URL, because `#platform/*` is a bare specifier and a browser needs an import
map to resolve one. Bundlers resolve it (verified against esbuild, rolldown and rspack), and
the no-bundler case is what `dist/iife` is for. Deep paths were never part of the contract —
`exports` has only ever published the 19 subpaths.

**A second consumer is affected, and it is worth naming rather than discovering:** Jest
cannot resolve `imports` (`#`) specifiers under its experimental ESM mode. Measured on
jest 30.4.2 / Node 26.8.1, `await import("documonster/excel")` with
`--experimental-vm-modules` fails with `does not provide an export named …`, and a minimal
package with a single non-wildcard `#plat` entry fails identically — so this is the
`imports` field in general, not the wildcard and not this mapping. 14 of the 19 subpaths
reach a platform variant and are therefore affected; the other five (`markdown`, `mermaid`,
`formula`, `xml`, `word/markdown`) are not.

This is moot for the route a Jest user actually takes, because that route no longer goes
through Jest's ESM loader at all: the package is ESM-only, so a Jest consumer transpiles it
with `babel-jest` (see "CommonJS"), and Babel lowers `import "#platform/…"` to
`require("#platform/…")`, which Node's CommonJS resolver handles. The `imports` field is only
unresolvable in Jest's _own_ ESM implementation.

The alternative was to express the internal seam as a public `./internal/*` subpath in
`exports`, which Jest does resolve natively. It was rejected: it would publish 27 internal
modules as importable paths to work around one runner's experimental mode, and this
package's position is that the `dist/` layout is not a contract.

Note that TypeScript does **not** apply the `browser` condition by default under either
`bundler` or `nodenext` resolution: a consumer who wants the browser surface's types sets
`customConditions: ["browser"]`. That was equally true of the two-tree layout, so nothing
changed for them.

`src/utils/browser.ts` (`preferBrowserFilesPlugin`) is a separate mechanism for a separate
job: it swaps variants while bundling **from source**, which is what `rolldown.config.ts`
and `vitest.browser.config.ts` do. Source has no `#platform/*` specifiers to resolve.

## CommonJS

**The package is ESM-only.** Every `exports` subpath is `{ browser, types, default }` and
`default` names a file in `dist/esm`; there is no `require` condition and no transpiled tree.
A CommonJS consumer reaches it through `require(esm)`, and their call site does not change:

```js
const { Workbook } = require("documonster/excel"); // works verbatim
```

`dist/cjs` used to be a full second transpile — 10.7 MB unpacked, 2.4 MB of the packed
tarball, a third of everything an `npm install` downloaded — and it existed for a runtime
capability Node has since absorbed.

### Why `>=22.13.0` and not `>=22.12.0`

`require(esm)` was unflagged in 22.12, so 22.12 is where it starts _working_. But measured on
a real 22.12.0 binary, every `require()` of an ES module also prints:

```
ExperimentalWarning: CommonJS module … is loading ES Module … using require().
Support for loading ES Module in require() is an experimental feature and might change at any time
```

That is stderr noise on every process start, in every consumer's CI log. Verified across
22.12.0 / 22.13.0 / 22.22.1 / 24.16.0 / 26.8.1: the warning is present on 22.12.0 and gone
from 22.13.0 onward, while `require()` of all 19 subpaths succeeds on every one of them. So
the floor is the first version where the feature is both available and quiet.

### What this costs a consumer, and what it does not

Nothing changes for Node ESM, for a bundler, or for a `<script>` tag. Two populations are
affected:

- **Node 22.0 – 22.12.** 22.0–22.11 need `--experimental-require-module`; 22.12 works but
  warns. Upgrade.
- **TypeScript consumers on `moduleResolution: node16`.** That mode predates `require(esm)`
  and reports `TS1479` before Node is involved; `nodenext` accepts it. Measured on tsc 5.9:
  `nodenext`, `bundler` and the legacy `commonjs` + `node10` pair all compile, `node16` does
  not, and the emitted JavaScript runs in every case. It is a one-word change in their
  tsconfig, and `nodenext` is what TypeScript recommends for Node projects anyway.
- **Jest users.** Jest cannot `require()` an ES module at all — measured on jest 30.4.2 with
  transforms disabled, on Node 26.8.1, and against a local `.mjs` as a control, so this is
  Jest and not this package. Its own error text points at "Node v24.9+ where Jest supports
  require(esm) natively"; that did not hold. The fix is two files, verified working against
  the published shape:

  ```js
  // babel.config.cjs
  module.exports = { presets: [["@babel/preset-env", { targets: { node: "current" } }]] };
  ```

  ```json
  // jest.config.json
  {
    "transform": { "\\.[jt]sx?$": "babel-jest" },
    "transformIgnorePatterns": ["/node_modules/(?!documonster)"]
  }
  ```

That second cost is real but it is not unusual, and that is the calibration that decided
this. Requiring six of the eight most-depended-on packages tested — `strip-ansi` (527 M
weekly), `chalk` (507 M), `p-limit` (333 M), `uuid` (295 M), `nanoid` (243 M), `node-fetch`
(194 M) — fails in Jest with the identical message; only `axios` and `zod` still ship
CommonJS. Any Jest project whose dependency tree reaches one of those already carries that
`transformIgnorePatterns` line, so adding a name to it is a one-line change rather than a
new configuration. And all six switched at a _major_ version; this package is pre-1.0 with
`bump-minor-pre-major`, so now is the cheapest moment it will ever have.

### The standing rule this creates

`require(esm)` throws `ERR_REQUIRE_ASYNC_MODULE` on a module graph containing top-level
await. With no transpiled tree to fall back on, **top-level await would make the package
unrequirable from CommonJS.** So: do not introduce one. A zero-dependency document toolkit
has no need for it.

The whole matrix was measured against a real `npm install` of the packed tarball, not a
symlinked `node_modules`: all 19 subpaths `require()`d, destructured and executed on
22.12.0 / 22.13.0 / 22.22.1 / 24.16.0 / 26.8.1 and on Bun 1.4, plus ESM `import` on each.
`pnpm verify:install` is that check, and the `Consumer floor` CI job runs it on 22.13.0.

**Two floors, and conflating them breaks CI.** `engines.node` (>=22.13) is what a _consumer_
needs; the _toolchain_ needs >=22.18, because every gate is a `node scripts/*.ts` and Node's
type stripping is unflagged only from 22.18 — 22.17.1 still throws
`ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION`. Pinning the consumer floor in the `test` matrix therefore failed
all nine jobs for a reason unrelated to the package. So the `test` matrix runs `22.x`, and the
floor is verified where it can be: against the installed artifact, by the one script here
written in plain CommonJS (`scripts/verify-installed-package.cjs`) so that it runs there at all.

One methodological trap is worth recording, because it produced a wrong "verified" reading
first time round: the `ExperimentalWarning` goes through `process.emitWarning`, which defers
to the next tick, so a harness ending in `process.exit()` never sees it and 22.12 looks
clean. `verify:cjs` waits for the child to exit for that reason.

That is a gate, not a hope. `pnpm verify:cjs` and
`src/test/__tests__/cjs-entrypoints.node.test.ts` `require()` all 19 entry points, and the
test first pins the mechanism against a fixture — one case proves `require(esm)` works on a
plain module, another proves it throws on top-level await — so the suite cannot pass because
Node stopped caring. Verified by appending an `await` to `markdown/index.ts`:
`✗ verify:cjs — 1 of 19 entry point(s) failed to require()`.

Deleting the CommonJS transpile also removed a whole class of bug with it. `tsc`'s CommonJS
emit preserved statement order where ESM hoists its bindings, so an import written at the end
of a file landed below its consumer and threw
`ReferenceError: Cannot access 'grapheme_1' before initialization` at load. That shipped once,
breaking 12 of the 19 CJS entries while the entire test suite stayed green — because the tests
run against source, through ESM. There is now one emit, so source and artifact cannot disagree
that way.

## Documentation

Examples are the first thing a consumer copies, and until recently they were the only artefact
here that nothing in the toolchain read — so they drifted, silently and with the authority of
sitting next to the implementation. `scripts/verify-doc-examples.ts` (`pnpm verify:doc-examples`,
included in `pnpm check`) closes that: it resolves every documented import **and** every
`Namespace.member` reference against the built public surface by handing them to `tsc`.

What it found on its first two runs is the reason it exists: seventeen `@example` blocks in
`pdf/` and `word/` still naming the flat exports those modules replaced with namespace surfaces
(`readPdf` → `Pdf.read`, `toBuffer` → `Io.toBuffer`, …); eleven more of the same in the READMEs,
which carry five times as many imports; a `Document.addBodyContent` that has never existed; and
a comment instructing readers to call four members on `StyleMap`, which resolves — to a _type_
of that name, while the namespace is published as `Styles`.

Rules when writing documentation:

- **Name the public form**, not the internal function it forwards to. `Pdf.read`, not `readPdf`;
  `Worksheet.Handle`, not `WorksheetData`.
- **Put runnable code in a fence.** Markdown is checked inside fenced blocks only; inline code
  in a sentence is treated as a reference to a symbol, which is what lets a document _discuss_
  a broken import. TSDoc comments are read in full, prose included, because their prose
  instructs.
- **Use braced imports** (`import { A, B } from "documonster/x"`). A namespace or default import
  is reported rather than skipped — a gate with a silent hole is worse than no gate.
- **Keep local links real.** `scripts/verify-doc-links.ts` checks relative files, directories,
  images and Markdown heading fragments. External URLs are deliberately not fetched. Heading
  anchors follow GitHub's rule, including the two details that surprise people: a dropped
  character between spaces leaves _two_ hyphens (`Excel — XLSX` → `excel--xlsx`), and a
  leading emoji leaves a leading hyphen (`⚠ BREAKING` → `-breaking`).
- **Do not restate counts.** A number only a human keeps in sync is eventually wrong: the
  function count said 433 in sixteen places while the registry held 448.
  `src/modules/formula/__tests__/function-count.node.test.ts` pins the twelve that remain against
  `listFunctionNames()`. It carries the `.node` suffix because it reads Markdown off disk: the
  browser config excludes `*.node.test.ts` by glob, which is a rule rather than a hand-kept list.
- A member a comment names _in order to say it is absent_ goes in that script's
  `DELIBERATELY_ABSENT` map, keyed by file, and is documented there.

## Code Style

- **Type-only imports**: `import type { Foo } from "..."`
- **Error handling**: Extend `BaseError` from `@utils/errors`, use `{ cause }` for chaining.
- **Files**: kebab-case. **Browser variants**: `*.browser.ts` — see below.
- **Formatting**: Handled entirely by Prettier — just run `pnpm format`.
- **Tests**: Vitest, in `__tests__/*.test.ts`. Timeout: 30s.
  - **Co-locate tests next to the code they cover.** A test lives in the `__tests__/` directory of the module subfolder it exercises — e.g. `core/__tests__/`, `surface/__tests__/`, `stream/__tests__/`, `chart/__tests__/`, `bridge/__tests__/`, `utils/__tests__/`, `xlsx/__tests__/`. The `xlsx/__tests__/` tree mirrors the `xlsx/xform/` source layout. Do not pile module tests into a single top-level `__tests__/`.
  - **Shared fixtures stay centralized.** Cross-cutting test assets — `data/` (binary `.xlsx`/`.png`/`.csv` fixtures), `helpers/` (e.g. `expect-valid-xlsx`, `zip-text`, `external-oracle`), and `shared/` (reusable sheet builders) — live in `src/modules/excel/__tests__/` and are imported via the `@excel/__tests__/...` alias from any co-located test. A test that is private to one subfolder may keep a private helper beside it (e.g. `chart/__tests__/chart-builder.helpers.ts`).
  - **Browser tests** stay under a `__tests__/browser/` directory (matched by `vitest.browser.config.ts`); keep their `__screenshots__/` baselines alongside them.
  - **A Node-only test is named `*.node.test.ts`, and that is machine-enforced.** `vitest.browser.config.ts` re-runs whole directories of Excel/Word/formula/xml/markdown/draw tests in a real Chromium, so a test that reads `process`, `Buffer`, `__dirname`/`__filename` or imports `node:*` has to opt out by name — the config excludes `*.node.test.ts` by glob. `.oxlintrc.json` carries an override whose `files`/`excludeFiles` mirror that config's `include`/`exclude` and turn on `no-restricted-globals` and `no-restricted-imports` there, so `pnpm lint` catches it in seconds. Before that, the only thing catching it was the `Browser` CI job — a `dist/` build plus a real browser, over two minutes, after the push — and three files landed at once breaking it.
    - Prefer keeping a file platform-free over renaming it: a `globalThis` probe (`(globalThis as { process?: … }).process`) or a platform-free helper from `@utils/binary` (`decodeBytesToString` instead of `Buffer.from(x).toString("hex")`) keeps the browser coverage. Rename, or split the Node-only cases into a `.node.test.ts` sibling, only when the test genuinely needs the platform — a top-level `node:` import cannot be skipped at runtime, so it must be split.
    - Two known edges. `typeof process !== "undefined"` is reported like a bare read, so write the `globalThis` probe instead — it is the form the rest of the tree uses. And the globs match `*.test.ts` only, so a `*.helpers.ts` beside a browser-run test is not linted; the `Browser` job is still the backstop for that one.

## Functions, Arrow Functions & Classes

Choose the form by purpose, not by preference. Do **not** make everything an arrow function — each form exists for a reason.

- **Top-level named functions → `function` declarations.** Use `function foo() {}` for module-level functions. They are hoisted (free ordering, no top-of-file dependency dance), carry a real name in stack traces, and support recursion cleanly.
- **Callbacks & inline functions → arrow functions.** Use arrows for `map`/`filter`/`forEach`, promise chains, event handlers, and anywhere lexical `this` is wanted. Keep bodies expression-form when possible (`x => x * 2`, not `x => { return x * 2; }`).
- **Overloads & generators → must be `function`.** Multiple call signatures (TS overloads) and `function*` generators cannot be expressed as arrows.
- **Class members → method syntax, never arrow fields.** Write `load() {}`, not `load = () => {}`. Methods live on the prototype and are shared across instances; arrow fields allocate a fresh function per instance (measured ~5× memory on hot value types like `Cell`/`Token`/XML nodes) and add per-`new` construction cost. Only use an arrow field when a method is detached and passed as a callback that genuinely needs bound `this`.
- **Avoid named function expressions** (`const foo = function bar() {}`); prefer a `function` declaration or an arrow.

### Prefer plain functions over classes

- **Don't reach for `class` by default.** If a unit of behavior is just data + a few transforms, prefer plain functions operating on plain objects/interfaces over a class. Modules with named exports already give you encapsulation and namespacing.
- **Use a `class` only when you genuinely need** instance identity with mutable state, inheritance/polymorphism, lifecycle (`implements`/`extends`), or a public API where `new`/methods read more naturally than free functions.
- **Avoid classes that are just namespaces** — a class with only static members (or a single method) should be plain exported functions instead.

## Examples

All runnable examples write output to `tmp/` under the project root. This directory is gitignored.

`scripts/run-examples.ts` (`pnpm verify:examples`, and the `Examples` CI job) **discovers and
runs every one of them**. Until it did, examples were the only artefact here that nothing
executed: the runner carried a hand-written list covering a sixth of the tree, and no CI job
invoked it. The first full run found six failures — five examples that could not resolve their
imports and one that hit a genuine `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` in the PDF
exporter (`push(...parts)` turning an unbounded array into an argument list). A seventh surfaced
on the second run: an example that could not run twice.

It runs at two levels, because the two ways an example breaks are different. The pre-commit hook
runs `--changed`: the examples the commit edits, plus every example beside a `utils/` helper it
edits, which is seconds. The `Examples` CI job runs **all** of them, catching an example broken
by a change to the library it calls; that is over a minute, too slow for a hook. It is
deliberately absent from `pnpm test`, which CI runs across every supported Node version and
three operating systems: the failures this catches are neither version- nor platform-specific,
so repeating them once per matrix cell would buy nothing.

Both the discovery rules and `--changed` are covered by
`src/test/__tests__/run-examples.test.ts`, against fixture trees built to break each one — the
runner takes `--root` for that, like the other gates. The hook used to carry its own shell
pattern for the same job, and it had drifted three ways: renames were skipped, nested example
directories were invisible, and a path containing a space was split in two.

Rules when writing an example:

- **Use the public API.** An example that has to import from `@excel/core/...`, `@pdf/reader/...`
  or `__tests__/` is either the wrong file or evidence of a missing public member — treat it as
  the latter until proven otherwise. That is how `Row.addPageBreak`, `Column.setNumFmt` and
  `Cell.find` came to exist.
- **Be re-runnable.** The gate runs an example against the `tmp/` output of its own previous
  run. Anything that defaults to `overwrite: "error"` needs the opt-in.
- **Write only to `tmp/`.** Accept an optional output path as `process.argv[2]` and default it
  under `tmp/`; never write into the source tree.
- **Run it with `pnpm example`, not `npx tsx`.** `tsx` hands the resolved path to Node's ESM
  resolver, which treats a dot-suffix as a complete filename — so a specifier ending `.node` or
  `.browser` never gets `.ts` appended, and this repository's platform-variant convention breaks.
  `pnpm example` runs `node --import @oxc-node/core/register`, which resolves both tsconfig
  `paths` and an extensionless TypeScript target. Node's own `--experimental-strip-types` is not
  enough either: it is strip-only and this tree uses parameter properties. Fifty-three
  `Run: npx tsx …` comments said otherwise; five of them were instructions that could not work.
- **A benchmark is not an example.** Something that measures internal machinery against the
  platform's belongs in `benchmark/`, where reaching into internals is legitimate. Two stream
  benchmarks sat in `examples/` and were the sole reason anything wanted `@utils/event-emitter`
  published.
- **Fixtures live in `examples/data/`,** not in `__tests__/data/`. The test tree is excluded from
  every build and absent from the published package, so an example reading from it cannot be
  copied — and its output would be coupled to an asset free to change for unrelated reasons.
  A file needed by both is duplicated on purpose.
