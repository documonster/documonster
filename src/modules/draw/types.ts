/**
 * Structured drawing IR — the interchange format for everything this library
 * draws.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The renderers grew up passing an *SVG string* between themselves: the chart
 * engine emitted SVG, then the Node PNG fallback re-parsed that string with a
 * regex scanner and the PDF importer parsed it again with a second, differently
 * capable parser. Every backend therefore had its own idea of what an attribute
 * meant, and the same picture came out differently depending on which one you
 * asked — dashes vanished, opacity was ignored, rotations mirrored, colours were
 * read with the wrong byte order.
 *
 * A display list removes the round trip. Producers describe geometry once;
 * each backend consumes the same nodes. SVG becomes one *output* rather than the
 * lingua franca.
 *
 * ## Shape of the model
 *
 * - Coordinates are in a single user space with **Y pointing down**, matching
 *   SVG and the chart scene. Backends that are Y-up (PDF) flip in their own
 *   adapter, which is the only place that knows about it.
 * - `group` carries an affine transform. {@link renderDrawList} maintains the
 *   current transform and hands surfaces **already-transformed, absolute**
 *   coordinates, so a surface never implements transform stacking. Producers get
 *   convenient nesting; backends stay flat.
 * - Paths are limited to move / line / cubic / close. Arcs are converted to
 *   cubics by {@link arcToCubics} at construction time, because every backend can
 *   draw a cubic and only some can draw an arc.

 * For backends whose rectangle primitive has no corner radius. The chart PDF
 * adapter draws onto a narrow surface whose `drawRect` takes no radius, so a
 * rounded panel came out square there while the SVG output rounded it — a
 * divergence the old renderer documented as unavoidable. It is avoidable whenever
 * the surface can take a path.
 *
 * `radius` is clamped to half the shorter side, as SVG does.
