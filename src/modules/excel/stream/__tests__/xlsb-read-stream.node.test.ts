/**
 * The two decoders a streaming XLSB read is built from.
 *
 * **Both are checked against the buffered reader rather than against constants.** A hand-written expectation here
 * would test my transcription of the format; comparing the streamed output to the output the rest of the library
 * already produces tests the thing that matters, which is that a caller cannot tell the two apart.
 *
 * **The fixtures are written here, not borrowed from the examples' output.** They used to be read out of
 * `tmp/excel-examples/`, which is gitignored and produced by a *different* CI job — so on a clean checkout these tests
 * failed outright (17 of them), and locally they passed only because a previous example run had left the files behind.
 * A test whose input another job happens to have created is a test whose result depends on what else has run.
 *
 * Building them here also makes the pair honest in a second way: the packages the streaming decoders are checked against
 * are ones this library wrote in this process, so a change to the writer reaches this test immediately.
 *
 * Carries `.node` because it writes the fixtures to a temporary directory.
