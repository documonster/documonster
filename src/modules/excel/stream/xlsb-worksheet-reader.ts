/**
 * An XLSB worksheet as a stream of rows.
 *
 * **One reader surface, two decoders.** `Stream.WorkbookReader` hands out a `WorksheetReader` whose `parse()` yields
 * `{ eventType: "row", value: RowData }`; the XML path produces those from SAX events and this produces the same ones
 * from BIFF12 records. A caller writes one loop and cannot tell which container it is reading, which is the property
 * that makes this worth having rather than a second API.
 *
 * ## What streams and what does not
 *
 * A row is emitted as soon as the next row header arrives, so nothing accumulates: a million-row sheet is a million
 * events and one row of memory. What must exist *first* is the shared-string table and the style table, because a
 * cell record holds an index into each rather than a value — `BrtCellIsst` is a number. The workbook reader already
 * handles that for XLSX by spooling a sheet that arrives before `sharedStrings`, and the same mechanism covers this.
 *
 * ## What a streamed read does not surface
 *
 * Measured against the buffered reader on this library's own examples, not assumed — `conditional-formatting` streams
 * 35 of 35 cells identically, and the three omissions below are exactly where the two disagree:
 *
 * - **Formulas arrive as their cached value.** `BrtFmlaNum` carries both the result and the token stream, and decoding
 *   the tokens needs the workbook's sheet names, defined names and table indices. A streamed read yields the number
 *   Excel last computed, which is what a bulk read wants; a caller who needs the expression reads the workbook.
 * - **Rich text arrives flattened.** A styled string's runs live in the shared-string table beside the text, and a
 *   cell that points at one gets the text without the runs.
 * - **Everything after `BrtEndSheetData`** — merges, conditional formats, data validations, panes, page setup,
 *   hyperlinks, comments. A forward reader has emitted its rows before those records arrive, so they cannot be
 *   attached to cells a caller has already seen. The XML streaming reader has the same limitation for the same
 *   reason. A merged region's continuation cells therefore stream as empty rather than repeating the anchor's value.
 *
 * None of these is reported as a loss, because nothing is lost from the *file*: they are absent from the events, and
 * the buffered reader is where a caller goes for them.
