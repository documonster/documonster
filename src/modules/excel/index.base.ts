/**
 * documonster/excel — base exports (platform independent).
 *
 * Shared domain dot-namespaces + error classes for both the Node and browser
 * entries. The two platform-specific namespaces (`Workbook`, `Stream`) are
 * NOT here — each entry (`index.ts` / `index.browser.ts`) re-exports this base
 * and then adds its own platform variant of those two. Mirrors the word
 * module's `index.base.ts` structure.
 *
 *   import { Workbook, Worksheet, Cell, Chart } from "documonster/excel";
 *   const wb = Workbook.create();
 *   const ws = Workbook.addWorksheet(wb, "Sheet1");
 *   Cell.setValue(ws, "A1", 42);
 *   const buf = await Workbook.toXlsxBuffer(wb);
 *
 * Each namespace is an ESM namespace re-export over a physical `surface/*.ts`
 * module of flat functions, which tree-shakes per-member on rolldown / rspack.
