/**
 * documonster/excel — base exports (platform independent).
 *
 * Shared domain dot-namespaces + error classes for both the Node and browser
 * entries. The two platform-specific namespaces (`Workbook`, `Stream`) are
 * NOT here — each entry (`index.ts` / `index.browser.ts`) re-exports this base
 * and then adds its own platform variant of those two. Mirrors the word
 * module's `index.base.ts` structure.
 *
 *   import { Workbook, Worksheet, Cell, Chart } from "documonster/excel";
 *   const wb = Workbook.create();
 *   const ws = Workbook.addWorksheet(wb, "Sheet1");
 *   Cell.setValue(ws, "A1", 42);
 *   const buf = await Workbook.toBuffer(wb);
 *
 * Each namespace is an ESM namespace re-export over a physical `surface/*.ts`
 * module of flat functions, which tree-shakes per-member on rolldown / rspack.
 *
 * The public **types** are exported flat, under their declared names — see the
 * "Public types" section below and the "Types" section of the module README.

// Public types (platform-independent)
//
// Flat, declared-name re-exports — the same convention every other module uses
// (`word`, `csv`, `xml`, `archive`, `pdf`, `stream`): a type has exactly one
// public name, and it is the name TypeScript prints in errors and hovers.
//
// The one deliberate exception is handles. Where a namespace already publishes
// a `Handle` alias (`Worksheet.Handle`, `Workbook.Handle`, `Table.Handle`, …)
// that alias IS the public name, so the underlying `WorksheetData` /
// `WorkbookData` / … interfaces are not re-exported here — a second name for
// the same type would be worse than none. Cell / row / column handles have no
// such alias, so their declared names are public (see below).
//
// The two platform-specific groups (workbook IO / streaming option types) are
// added by `index.ts` and `index.browser.ts`, next to their namespaces.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Style vocabulary — `Cell.setStyle`, `Row.setStyle`, `Column.setStyle`,
// `Table` column styles and `Workbook.defineCellStyle` all speak these.
