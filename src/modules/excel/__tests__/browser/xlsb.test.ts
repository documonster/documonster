/**
 * XLSB in a browser.
 *
 * The reason this file exists is a bug the Node suite could not see. `writeXlsbPackage` is on the
 * browser IO path, and its base64 image decoder called `Buffer.from` — so writing a workbook whose
 * picture arrived as base64 threw `ReferenceError: Buffer is not defined` in a browser while the same
 * workbook wrote correctly under Node. Every XLSB image test was `*.node.test.ts`, which the browser
 * config excludes by glob, so nothing ran the failing path. Adding the fix without adding this file
 * would have left the next one just as invisible.
 *
 * These are deliberately end-to-end through the public surface: the point is not that a codec works
 * but that the *browser build* of the whole write-then-read path does.
