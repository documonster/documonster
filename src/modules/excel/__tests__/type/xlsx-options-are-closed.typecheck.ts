// It pins the XLSX option bags as *closed* object types.

// Both interfaces used to carry an `[key: string]: unknown` index signature,
// justified in a comment as "forward compatibility / for callers who subclass
// `XLSX` to pass through private flags". What it actually bought was that any
// unknown key — a typo, an option from a different serializer, an option that
// was renamed two versions ago — type-checked at the call site and was then
// dropped on the floor. For a write option that means producing a file which
// differs from the one the caller asked for, with nothing reporting it.
//
// Removing the signature broke nothing in this repository, which is the whole
// point: nothing was using the escape hatch, and it was only ever load-bearing
// for mistakes. These assertions keep it from coming back, because a
// reintroduced index signature makes every `@ts-expect-error` below unused and
// therefore an error in its own right.
