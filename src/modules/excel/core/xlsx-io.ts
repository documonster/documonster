 *
 * **Timing this?** Measure with `NODE_ENV=production`. Outside production (and outside
 * vitest) every write runs the OOXML self-check, which re-parses the package it just
 * produced — measured at 38 ms against 124 ms on a 100-column × 200-row table, so a

 * // ❌ Deadlocks above ~128 KB of output: the consumer is attached only after

 * const passThrough = new PassThrough();
 * await Workbook.writeStream(wb, passThrough);

 * // ✅ Or hand out a source and let the consumer pull — no ordering contract.
 * await upload(Workbook.toStream(wb));

 * Serialize a workbook into a readable byte stream.

 * The consumer drives production: serialization starts on the first read and

 * the writer forever.
 *
 * ```ts
 * await pipeline(Workbook.toStream(wb), createWriteStream("report.xlsx"));
 * for await (const chunk of Workbook.toStream(wb)) {
 *   // …
 * }
 * // SDKs that demand a nominal `stream.Readable` (upload bodies, `toWeb`)
 * // take it directly — no `Readable.from()` adapter, no cast:
 * const body = Workbook.toStream(wb);
 * const web = Readable.toWeb(Workbook.toStream(wb));
 * ```
 *
 * The return type refines {@link XlsxReadable} rather than replacing it: it is
 * still assignable to `XlsxReadable`, which is identical in both builds, so
 * cross-platform code written against that name keeps compiling while Node code
 * gets the nominal `stream.Readable`.
 *
 * {@link XlsxStreamOptions.highWaterMark} is not a hard memory bound:
 * backpressure is sampled after each ZIP entry, and a worksheet is rendered as
 * one entry, so peak buffering may substantially exceed the
 * configured value and is usually driven by the largest worksheet. See
 * {@link XlsxStreamOptions.highWaterMark} for how `Stream.WorkbookWriter`
 * compares.
 *
 * Do not mutate the workbook until the stream ends. A consumer that abandons the
 * stream should `destroy()` it, which releases the parked writer; serialization
 * failures surface as an `'error'` event, so consume through `stream.pipeline()`
 * or `for await` rather than a bare `.pipe()`.
 *
 * ### Leaving `for await` early
 *
 * Reading the first N chunks and `break`ing is Node's semantics, not this
 * stream's, and the two teardown paths do **not** look alike:
 *
 * ```ts
 * for await (const chunk of Workbook.toStream(wb)) break;
 * // stream.errored === AbortError: The operation was aborted
 * ```
 *
 * Node's async iterator destroys the stream with an `AbortError` on early exit
 * (`createAsyncIterator` → `destroyer`), whereas calling `destroy()` yourself
 * destroys it with no error. Nothing crashes — the iterator handles the event, so
 * an absent `'error'` listener is not an unhandled error — but a listener that
 * *is* attached receives a spurious `AbortError`, and `stream.errored` is set, so
 * code that reports either as a serialization failure will report a false one.
 *
 * Two ways to leave early *silently*, both of which still release the parked
 * writer:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // 1. destroy first, then break
 * const stream = Workbook.toStream(wb);
 * for await (const chunk of stream) {
 *   if (enough(chunk)) {
 *     stream.destroy();
 *     break;
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // 2. opt out of the iterator's teardown — but then YOU must destroy it,
 * //    or the serializer stays parked
 * const stream = Workbook.toStream(wb);
 * try {
 *   for await (const chunk of stream.iterator({ destroyOnReturn: false })) {
 *     if (enough(chunk)) break;
 *   }
 * } finally {
 *   stream.destroy();
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The browser build destroys silently on early exit instead, so `errored` is not
 * a portable way to tell "the consumer stopped" from "serialization failed" —
 * track that yourself if the same code runs on both platforms.
