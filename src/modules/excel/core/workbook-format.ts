/**
 * Workbook package format dispatch.
 *
 * XLSX and XLSB are two encodings of the same document, so the canonical IO functions treat
 * the format as a choice rather than exposing a second API. This module holds the choosing.
 *
 * ## The cost of detection is charged carefully
 *
 * Both formats are OPC ZIP packages and the only reliable difference is which workbook part
 * is present, so detecting one means reading the ZIP central directory. Two things make that
 * cheap enough to do unconditionally, and both were mistakes worth avoiding rather than
 * hypotheticals:
 *
 *  * **The input is normalised once.** A base64 string is decoded a single time and the bytes
 *    are handed to whichever loader runs. Sniffing on the string and then letting the loader
 *    decode it again doubles the work and the peak memory on the largest input a caller can
 *    supply.
 *  * **A file path is decided by its extension.** `readFile` on Node streams the ZIP rather
 *    than buffering it, which is a real advantage for a large XLSX; sniffing would mean
 *    reading the tail first and giving that up. `.xlsb` selects the binary reader, everything
 *    else keeps the streaming path, and an explicit `format` overrides both.
 *
 * ## The XLSB reader and writer are loaded on demand
 *
 * Only the *detection* is unconditional, and it lives in `xlsb/detect.ts` for that reason: it is
 * a ZIP central-directory scan and nothing more. Everything that acts on the answer —
 * `parseXlsbPackage`, `commitXlsbRead`, `writeXlsbPackage` — is reached through `await import()`,
 * which the functions below can do because they are all async already.
 *
 * This paragraph used to be a single sentence at the bottom of the file asserting the same thing
 * while the imports at the top were static, and the difference was measurable: `Workbook.read`
 * eagerly bundled the whole binary reader and `Workbook.toBuffer` the whole binary writer, in both
 * cases to decide they were not needed. It also made the streaming paths' own `await import()` of
 * those two modules ineffective — a module that is statically imported anywhere in the graph is
 * hoisted into the main chunk, so nobody's dynamic import of it can move it out.

 *
 * - Writing defaults to `"error"`. The workbook is in memory and complete, so a loss is the writer's
 *   limitation and refusing costs the caller nothing they had.
 * - Reading defaults to `"ignore"`. The loss already happened, in a file someone else wrote; a reader
 *   that refuses a real workbook because seven of its cells use a record whose layout is unestablished
 *   is a reader nobody can use. `"error"` is for a caller who would rather stop than convert something
 *   incomplete, which is the converter's position rather than the viewer's.
 *
 * Either way the thrown error carries the list on `items`, so a caller does not parse the message.
 *
 * **The check happens before anything is applied.** The package is read into a model of its own, the
 * policy is evaluated against that model's diagnostics, and only then is the caller's workbook
 * replaced — so a rejected read leaves the target exactly as it was. Checking afterwards, which is
 * what this did first, made `"error"` mean "replace the workbook, then report failure": a rejection
 * the caller could not recover from, and the opposite of what the scratch workbook was added for.
