/**
 * The streaming zip a binary package is written into.
 *
 * A one-line factory in a file of its own, and the reason is a layer rule rather than tidiness: the adapter
 * lives in `xlsx/zip-writer.ts`, and `core/xlsb-stream.ts` must not import the XLSX module — it describes the zip
 * structurally so that it does not. Something has to bridge the two, and doing it here keeps that import in one
 * place instead of at every call site.
 *
 * The adapter itself is shared on purpose. A ZIP is a ZIP; the streamed XLSX path and the streamed XLSB path
 * have the same backpressure, the same entry lifecycle and the same finalisation, and a second implementation
 * would be a second set of those to get wrong.
