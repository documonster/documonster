 * browser declaration was told something the Node one did not say. Adding a field to only one of them is
 * the failure this file exists to make impossible.
 *
 * What genuinely differs stays in the variants: `toBuffer` returns a `Buffer` on Node and a
 * `Uint8Array` in a browser, the stream types are each platform's own, and file-path IO is Node-only.

   *   formatted region, so a sheet with a formatted column has one per row to the sheet's end — measured at 186 MB of
   *   retained heap and 16,379 physical rows against 253 rows of actual data, against 0.4 MB and 253 rows collapsed.

   * physical rows against 200 rows of data, writing back to an identical 148,820 bytes.

   * **Crossing containers costs nothing either, and the warning that used to sit here was wrong.** It said "a collapsed
   * read written as XLSX loses the blank formatting. That loss is currently silent". Measured on 300 styled blanks in one
   * column, all four combinations — `keep`/`collapse` read, written as XLSX/XLSB — come back with 300 formatted blanks and
   * the same fill on each. Both writers expand the rectangles; the XLSX one does it in `worksheet-xform`, the XLSB one in
   * `model-adapter`. There is no report owed because there is no loss.

   *   arbitrary file wants.
   * - `"cached"` does not decode expressions at all: every formula cell becomes its cached value. Choose it to pull
   *   numbers out of a large workbook without paying for token decoding, or when Excel's computed value is worth more
   *   to you than an expression reconstructed by this library.
   * - `"error"` throws `XlsbFormulaDecodeError` on the first expression that fails, naming the sheet and the addresses.
   *   Choose it when a dropped formula makes the result wrong rather than merely poorer — a pipeline that recalculates
   *   the workbook would otherwise silently inherit a constant where a computation belonged.
