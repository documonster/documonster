/**
 * Dates as calendar values: the Temporal surface, the parts surface, and the timezone bug both exist to fix.
 *
 * **The bug this file is really about.** `Cell.setValue(sheet, "A1", new Date(2024, 0, 15))` — a locally
 * constructed `Date`, which is the form nearly every JavaScript programmer writes — stores a different serial in
 * every timezone, because a `Date` is an instant and the library reads it as a calendar value through its UTC
 * fields. In UTC+8 the cell becomes 2024-01-14 16:00. The convention is right and documented, but it is
 * unwritable in a type and so unguessable at the call site.
 *
 * That failure was invisible to this suite for a structural reason worth naming: every CI runner is UTC, and
 * `excel-date-serial.test.ts` fed only `Date.UTC(...)` inputs. A test that constructs its inputs the same way the
 * implementation reads them cannot detect a disagreement about which reading is meant. So the assertions below
 * run under {@link ZONES} — one east of UTC, one west, and one past the date line — and the ones that matter are
 * about *invariance*: the same call must produce the same cell everywhere.
 *
 * The Temporal blocks are skipped where the runtime has no `Temporal`, which is every supported version below
 * Node 26 and every Safari. The parts blocks are not skipped anywhere, which is the point of their existing.
 *
 * The zone matrix is the one part that cannot run everywhere: moving the process's timezone needs a writable
 * `process.env.TZ`, and a browser page has no way to be told it is somewhere else, so those cases are skipped
 * there. CI runs the whole Node suite a second time under `TZ=Asia/Shanghai`, which is where that coverage
 * actually comes from.
