 * bare `PassThrough`) deadlocks: once its buffers fill (64 KB per side, so

 * because nothing is reading, and this promise never settles. Small workbooks
 * that fit inside those buffers appear to work, which makes the failure look
 * size-dependent.

 * not already running.

 * // ❌ Deadlocks above ~128 KB of output: the consumer is attached only after
 * //    this promise resolves, which never happens.
 * const passThrough = createPassThrough<Uint8Array>();
 * await Workbook.writeStream(wb, passThrough);
 * await upload(passThrough);
 *
 * // ✅ Start the consumer first, then await the producer.
 * const passThrough = createPassThrough<Uint8Array>();
 * const uploading = upload(passThrough);
 * await Workbook.writeStream(wb, passThrough);
 * await uploading;
 *
 * // ✅ Or hand out a source and let the consumer pull — no ordering contract.
 * await upload(Workbook.toStream(wb));
 *
 * // ✅ Or buffer the package in memory.
 * await upload(await Workbook.toBuffer(wb));
 * ```
 *
 * A sink that errors, or that closes before serialization finishes, rejects this
 * promise instead of hanging.

 * Serialize a workbook into a cross-platform readable byte stream.
 *
 * The consumer drives production: serialization starts on the first read and
 * pauses whenever the reader stops pulling. Unlike {@link writeStream} there is
 * no ordering contract to get wrong, so an unconsumed destination cannot park
 * the writer forever.
 *
 * ```ts
 * for await (const chunk of Workbook.toStream(wb)) {
 *   // …
 * }
 * await pipeline(Workbook.toStream(wb), sink);
 * const response = new Response(Readable.toWeb(Workbook.toStream(wb) as Readable));
 * ```
 *
 * {@link XlsxStreamOptions.highWaterMark} is not a hard memory bound:
 * backpressure is sampled after each ZIP entry, and a worksheet is rendered as
 * one entry, so peak buffering may substantially exceed the
 * configured value and is usually driven by the largest worksheet. See
 * {@link XlsxStreamOptions.highWaterMark} for how `Stream.WorkbookWriter`
 * compares.
 *
 * Do not mutate the workbook until the stream ends. A consumer that abandons the
 * stream should `destroy()` it, which releases the parked writer; serialization
 * failures surface as an `'error'` event, so consume through `pipeline()` or
 * `for await` rather than a bare `.pipe()`.
 *
 * ### Leaving `for await` early
 *
 * Breaking out of the loop destroys the stream with no error, so `errored` stays
 * `null` and no `'error'` listener fires. Use
 * `stream.iterator({ destroyOnReturn: false })` to keep the stream alive past the
 * loop — you then have to `destroy()` it yourself, or the serializer stays parked.
 *
 * Note this differs from the Node build, where Node's own async iterator destroys
 * the stream with an `AbortError` on early exit and sets `errored`. `errored` is
 * therefore not a portable way to distinguish "the consumer stopped" from
 * "serialization failed"; track that yourself if the same code runs on both.
