/**
 * Pull-side adapter for the XLSX writer.
 *
 * `XLSX.write(sink)` is push-shaped: it drives bytes into a destination and
 * only parks when that destination signals backpressure. That forces callers to
 * arrange the consumer *before* the producer runs, and getting the order wrong
 * parks the write forever on a `'drain'` that can never arrive.
 *
 * This module inverts the shape. The workbook is exposed as a readable byte
 * source whose reads are what drive serialization, so there is no ordering
 * contract to violate and the deadlock is structurally impossible. `@stream`
 * supplies the platform `Readable`, so the Node and browser IO surfaces share
 * this single implementation.
