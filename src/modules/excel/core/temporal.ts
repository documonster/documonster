/**
 * Temporal `Plain*` values as spreadsheet dates and times.
 *
 * **Why this is worth having, stated as a defect rather than as a preference.** A spreadsheet date is a civil
 * value — a date on a calendar, a time on a clock, no timezone. A JavaScript `Date` is an instant. The library
 * has always bridged the two by convention (a `Date` carries the civil value in its *UTC* fields), and that
 * convention is correct, but it is unwritable in a type and therefore unguessable by a caller. The form nearly
 * every JavaScript programmer reaches for —
 *
 * ```ts
 * Cell.setValue(sheet, "A1", new Date(2024, 0, 15));
 * ```
 *
 * — is the wrong one, and fails *quietly and only outside UTC*: in UTC+8 it stores 45305.667, which Excel shows
 * as 2024-01-14 16:00. Nothing in the API can tell you, because both readings of that `Date` are legitimate and
 * it does not say which was meant.
 *
 * `Temporal.PlainDate` says which. That is the whole argument: not that Temporal is newer, but that the ambiguity
 * this library keeps tripping over does not exist in it.
 *
 * A second thing falls out that `Date` cannot express at all. `Date` conflates three cell kinds, and the number
 * format is what tells them apart — so a time-of-day written as a `Date` gets the default *date* format and shows
 * as `12-30-1899`. The three `Plain*` types are exactly that missing distinction, so a `PlainTime` can be given a
 * time format and a `PlainDate` a date one, without a caller having to know that a bare `Date` needs help.
 *
 * ## Availability
 *
 * Temporal is **not** available on this package's supported floor — not Node 22 or 24, not Safari, not Chrome
 * before 144 — and the zero-dependency rule forbids a polyfill. So it is opt-in on both sides and nothing here
 * touches the default surface:
 *
 * - **Types** are derived from `globalThis` by a conditional type rather than by naming the `Temporal` namespace.
 *   A consumer whose `lib` lacks `esnext.temporal` gets `never` and the member collapses; naming the namespace
 *   directly would give them `TS2503` in a declaration file they did not write.
 * - **Runtime** detection is `Symbol.toStringTag`, never `instanceof Temporal.PlainDate`. Evaluating that
 *   expression on Node 22 throws a `ReferenceError` at module scope, which would break `import` of
 *   `documonster/excel` for every consumer whether or not they use any of this. It is also the only form that
 *   works across realms.
 * - **`CellValue`** — the *read* type — is untouched. Only `CellValueInput` grows, which cannot break an
 *   exhaustive `switch`.
 *
 * A caller on an older runtime is not shut out: `Cell.getDateParts` returns {@link ExcelDateTimeParts}, and
 * `Temporal.PlainDate.from(parts)` is one line. The parts *are* the interchange format; Temporal is the ergonomic
 * skin over it.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately refused
 *
 * `Temporal.Instant` and `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` are instants, not civil values. Storing one requires choosing a
 * timezone to flatten it in, and there is no defensible default — so they are rejected by name, with the one-call
 * fix in the message. Guessing is how this module's subject matter became a bug in the first place.
 * `PlainYearMonth` and `PlainMonthDay` are incomplete dates and are refused for the same reason.
