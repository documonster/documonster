 *
 * Measured on `cal-any_sheets.xlsb` → XLSX: the workbook's theme carries `accent1 = 5B9BD5` and came out as the

 * `OpaqueDrop`s reach a caller through `WorkbookModel.opaqueDrops`, which the reader populates; a write never touches
 * the workbook's copy, so a reason a writer discovers has nowhere to go here. `"unreachable"` is produced by
 * `resolveReachableOpaqueParts` during a *write* and was assigned onto the throwaway model that write was given — a
 * report that had no reader. A `"foreign-sheet-part"` member was added beside it and was dead for the same reason, so it
 * is gone again.
 *
 * **Not every write-time drop is a loss, which is the other half of why this vocabulary is read-time.** An unreachable
 * part is one nothing in the written package points at, and removing it is the documented purpose of the filter — a
 * deleted sheet taking its drawing with it is correct, not damage. Reporting it as a loss made the *default*
 * `unsupported: "error"` refuse a perfectly good workbook. A part from the other container's sheet family *is* a loss —
 * an XLSB chartsheet has no form in a SpreadsheetML package — and `writeXlsbPackage` reports that one in `unsupported`,
 * beside everything else it cannot carry. An XLSX write has no such channel; see `resolveOpaqueReachability`.
