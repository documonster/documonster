/**
 * `BrtFill` — the fill table entry.
 *
 * **What the corpus establishes, and what it does not.** Sixty-eight bytes, and every one of the
 * nine Excel-authored reference workbooks contains exactly two of these records, differing in a single byte:
 * `fls` = 0 and `fls` = 0x11. Those are the two fills Excel emits into every workbook it writes —
 * `none` and `gray125` — and **17 is exactly where `gray125` sits** in the eighteen-value pattern
 * ordering. An enumeration confirmed at its first and its eighteenth position leaves no room for
 * the ordering to differ in between, which is what makes `solid` = 1 a reading rather than a
 * guess: were the order different anywhere below 17, `gray125` would not have landed on 17.
 *
 * The colour fields are the `BrtColor` established in `color.ts`, and the two the corpus contains
 * are the system foreground and background (indices 64 and 65) — self-consistent with their
 * resolved RGB, which is how they were confirmed.
 *
 * **No corpus fill has a real colour**, both being the defaults, so a solid fill carrying an RGB
 * is composed entirely of established parts but has never been observed as a whole. The gradient
 * fields after the two colours are left alone: nothing in the corpus sets them, and the model's
 * gradient fills degrade to their first stop rather than being invented here.
