/**
 * Assemble an XLSB package.
 *
 * The binary parts come from `workbook.ts`, `worksheet.ts` and `shared-strings.ts`; everything else in
 * the package is XML and is exactly the same XML an XLSX has. The relationship and content-type
 * writers are therefore reused rather than reimplemented — OPC is not the part of this that is
 * specific to XLSB, and a second relationships writer would be a second place for the same bug.
 *
 * What *is* specific: the workbook part is `xl/workbook.bin`, and its content type
 * declares a binary workbook. Getting that pair wrong is the fastest way to a package
 * Excel refuses, which is why `check-package.ts` looks at exactly those two things.
 *
 * This module owns the decisions that need to see the whole package at once, and each of them was a
 * bug first: what a drawing or a medium may be *named* (a preserved part may already hold the name),
 * which relationship ids are free (a preserved relationship may already hold `rId1`), and which
 * extensions this writer declares itself (a preserved part relying on a conflicting `Default` needs an
 * `Override`). None of those questions can be answered by a part writer looking at one sheet.

 * they resolve through. The reservation check is what keeps a preserved theme from being written twice
 * when a model somehow carries both.
 *
 * The third way is the built-in theme, and it exists because a workbook *built from scratch* has
 * neither of the other two: `model.themes` is undefined and there is nothing to preserve. The XLSX
 * writer has always defaulted in that case (`model.themes || { theme1: theme1Xml }`), so the same
 * model written to the two formats disagreed about whether a theme exists at all — and the XLSB was
 * the one that shipped dangling references. A theme slot is named, not inlined: every `{ theme: n }`
 * cell colour, every `<a:schemeClr>` in a chart sidecar and every `majorFont`/`minorFont` in a chart
 * style resolves through `xl/theme/theme1.xml`, so a package that omits the part while referencing it
 * is not merely plainer-looking — it is unresolvable, and Excel repairs it.
 *
 * `reservedPaths` is not a sufficient guard on its own here: a preserved theme is free to be named
 * `theme2.xml`, which would not collide with the default's path and would leave the workbook carrying
 * two themes. So the default is suppressed by the presence of *any* preserved theme, not by its name —
 * and by one that survives the reachability filter, since a dropped part suppressing the fallback
