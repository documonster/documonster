/**
 * Encoding one cell.
 *
 * A `BrtCell*` record is chosen by the *shape of the value*, not by the model's `type` discriminant —
 * and that is a decision rather than an oversight. A rich-text cell built through `Cell.setValue`
 * arrives with `type` set to `String` and its runs nested inside `value`, so the discriminant does not
 * discriminate; the shapes below were read off the model instead.
 *
 * The other decision worth naming is what happens when a cell cannot be encoded. It becomes a blank
 * **with its formatting intact**, and its address is reported. Writing the cached result of a formula
 * this module cannot express would produce a cell that shows the right number and never recalculates,
 * which is worse than one that admits it is empty.
