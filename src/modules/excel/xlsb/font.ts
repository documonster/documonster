/**
 * `BrtFont` — the font table entry.
 *
 * **How this layout was established.** Fifteen fonts across nine Excel-authored workbooks, and
 * the reading is self-checking: the name is an `XLWideString` at offset 21, so `25 + 2 × cch`
 * must equal the payload length exactly. It does for all fifteen, at four different name lengths
 * (`Arial`, `Calibri`, `FreeSans`, `等线`), which pins the header at 21 bytes.
 *
 * The division *within* those 21 bytes is pinned by values that cannot be coincidences:
 *
 * - `dyHeight` at 0 reads 200, 240, 220, 280, 180 across the corpus — exactly 10, 12, 11, 14 and
 *   9 point in twentieths. A wrong offset or scale would not produce five integral point sizes.
 * - `bCharSet` at 10 reads **204** in the workbook whose style name is `Обычный`, and **134** in
 *   the one whose font is named `等线`. 204 is Windows Cyrillic and 134 is GB2312. A byte that
 *   tracks the document's language is not at the wrong offset.
 * - `bFontScheme` at 20 reads **2** — minor — on precisely the 11-point Calibri fonts, which is
 *   Excel's default theme font, and 0 on every font that is not a theme font.
 * - `brtColor` at 12 spans all four colour kinds, each internally consistent. See `color.ts`.
 *
 * **What is *not* established, and this matters.** Every font in the corpus is regular weight
 * (`bls` = 400) and has `grbit` = 0. So the corpus fixes the offsets of the bold and italic
 * fields but never exercises their "on" state, and the values used for it are collected in
 * {@link INFERRED_FONT_VALUES} rather than scattered through this file — one list to check
 * against a new sample, which `INFERRED_VALUES` registers and `spec.test.ts` pins.

 * rather than replaced because a partial `defaultFont` — `{ name: "Arial" }` and nothing else — must

 *
 * **The baseline includes the colour**, and it did not. Without it `encodeColor` fell through to its last
 * branch and wrote the automatic colour (`01 40 …`) — a `BrtColor` of kind *automatic* carrying palette index
 * 64 — while Excel writes theme slot 1 (`07 01 … ff`) for the same font, and this library's own XLSX writer
 * emits `<color theme="1"/>`. So a from-scratch workbook described its default text colour one way in the XML
 * container and another in the binary one, and every one of the fifteen oracle cases differed on this record
 * for that single reason.
 *
 * The value is deliberately the same literal the XLSX side uses (`styles-xform.ts`'s default font), because
 * these are one fact about one workbook and a second copy is how the two came to disagree in the first place.
