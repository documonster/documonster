/**
 * BIFF12 styles: number formats, fonts, fills, and the cell-format table that indexes them.
 *
 * Number formats came first, and the ordering was deliberate rather than incidental. A cell's
 * `iFmt` is what turns `42663` into `2016-10-07` and `0.155` into `15.5%`, so without it a reader
 * produces numerically correct output that is *wrong on screen* — the one kind of fidelity loss a
 * user notices immediately. Fonts and fills change how a workbook looks; a missing number format
 * changes what it appears to say.
 *
 * **Borders are absent, and that is a finding rather than an omission.** All nine Excel-authored reference
 * workbooks contain exactly one `BrtBorder`, byte-identical across every file: the default
 * "no borders" entry. A corpus with one sample of a 51-byte structure establishes that the
 * structure is 51 bytes and nothing else — no edge, no style, no colour is ever exercised — so
 * there is nothing here to read off. See `font.ts` and `fill.ts` for what a corpus that *does*
 * vary makes establishable.
 *
 * ## The layout came from Excel's own output
 *
 * `BrtXF` is sixteen bytes, and the fields below were read off a real `styles.bin` rather than
 * guessed. The workbook that produced it has a date cell, and its third cell format carries
 * `iFmt = 14` — the built-in `mm-dd-yy` — which is what identified the field's offset:
 *
 * ```text
 * 00 00 | 0e 00 | 00 00 | 00 00 | 00 00 | 00 00 | 10 10 | 01 00
 * parent  iFmt    iFont   iFill   iBorder  …flags…
 * ```
 *
 * The built-in format strings are the ones `xlsx/defaultnumformats.ts` already carries. Reusing
 * them matters beyond saving a table: a reader that disagreed with the XLSX path about what
 * format 14 means would make the same file display differently depending on which container it
 * arrived in.
