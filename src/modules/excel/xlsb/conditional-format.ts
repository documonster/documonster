 * Conditional formatting: `BrtBeginConditionalFormatting` and the `BrtBeginCFRule` records inside it.
 *
 * ```text
 * BrtBeginConditionalFormatting   ccf (rule count), fPivot, sqrfx
 *   BrtBeginCFRule                iType, iTemplate, dxfId, iPri, iParam, 2 reserved,
 *                                 flags, cbFmla1..3, strParam, rgce1..3
 *   BrtEndCFRule
 * BrtEndConditionalFormatting
 * ```
 *
 * **The rule's shape is decided by a *pair* of enumerations, not one.** `iType` says how the formatting
 * is drawn — a comparison, an expression, a colour scale, a data bar, an icon set — and `iTemplate` says
 * what the condition is. MS-XLSB lists the legal combinations explicitly, and "other combinations MUST NOT
 * be used": a `cellIs` rule is `CF_TYPE_CELLIS` + `CF_TEMPLATE_EXPR`, while everything from
 * `containsText` to `aboveAverage` is `CF_TYPE_EXPRIS` with a different template. Writing the type alone
 * and leaving the template at 0 produces a rule Excel reads as a value comparison whatever it was.
 *
 * **The formatting itself is a `dxfId`,** an index into a workbook-level `BrtBeginDXFs` collection — not a
 * style inline in the rule. So a rule that fills a cell red needs an entry in that table, and the two
 * have to be written together. `collectDxfs` is that table.
 *
 * What is *not* written: the child records for the three graphical types. A colour scale needs a
 * `BrtBeginColorScale`, a data bar a `BrtBeginDatabar`, an icon set a `BrtBeginIconSet` — the
 * specification makes each a MUST for its type. Those three are reported rather than written with the
 * rule alone, because a `CF_TYPE_GRADIENT` rule with no `BrtBeginColorScale` is a record stream Excel
 * rejects rather than a rule that renders plainly.
