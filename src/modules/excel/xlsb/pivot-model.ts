 * One parsed cache-record value in the form the cache encoder wants.
 *
 * The two forms line up almost exactly: a `"x"` entry is already the shared-item index the encoder writes,
 * and `"n"`/`"s"`/`"b"`/`"d"` are already the value. The cases worth naming are the two that are not:
 *
 * - `"m"` is a missing value and carries none, so it becomes the same empty string a live source's blank
 *   cell yields through {@link cacheRecordValue};
 * - `"e"` is an error, whose text is the only thing a `BrtPCDIString` can hold.
 *
 * A field *with* shared items whose record is not an `"x"` is re-resolved through `cacheRecordValue` rather
 * than trusted: mixing the two forms in one column is what a hand-edited file does, and writing a literal
 * where the field declares an index desynchronises the row.
