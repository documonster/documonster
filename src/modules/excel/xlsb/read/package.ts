/**
 * Read an XLSB package into a workbook.

 * indistinguishable from an XLSX one — same handles, same accessors, same everything
 * downstream.
 *
 * Going through `Cell.setValue` rather than assembling a `WorkbookModel` and calling
 * `setWorkbookModel` is deliberate. The model is a serialisation shape with a dozen
 * interdependent fields, and building one by hand means reproducing invariants that the
 * cell API already maintains — dimensions, row materialisation, shared-string bookkeeping.
 * The cost is one function call per cell; the benefit is that a reader cannot construct a

 *
 * - It *added* to the target instead of replacing it. `Workbook.read` on a workbook that already had
 *   sheets appended new ones, kept the old defined names, and threw part-way through on a duplicate
 *   sheet name — while the XLSX path, which builds a model and applies it with `setWorkbookModel`,
 *   has always replaced. Two readers behind one public function disagreeing about what "read" means is
 *   not a defensible difference.
 * - It was not atomic. The epoch was assigned, then the names, then each sheet in turn, so a package
 *   that failed on its fourth sheet left the caller holding three sheets, a changed epoch and no
 *   error-free way to tell.
 *
 * The commit goes through `getWorkbookModel`/`setWorkbookModel` — the same pair the XLSX reader ends
 * with — rather than a hand-written field copy. That is the point: a field the pair does not carry is
 * already not carried for an XLSX read, so the two formats cannot drift apart here, and adding a field
 * to the model does not create a third place to remember.
 *
 * A field-by-field copy would be cheaper and is wrong for a reason worth recording, because it looks
 * like it would work: a worksheet holds a back-reference to the workbook that owns it, so moving the
 * `_worksheets` array across leaves every sheet pointing at the scratch workbook. `setWorkbookModel`
 * rebuilds them against the target, which is exactly the coupling a property copy would silently break.
 *
 * The measured cost of the transplant is about 50 ms on a 20,000-row, 40,000-cell workbook — 76 ms to
 * 124 ms. That is proportionate rather than free, and the comparison that settles it is the other
 * reader: XLSX reads the same data in 264 ms, and pays this same cost at the end for the same reason.
 * An XLSB read remains more than twice as fast, and it is now as difficult to leave a workbook
 * half-updated as it already was there.
 *

 *          the decision belongs to the caller: a workbook whose cells read but whose rich text did not
 *          is still useful, and `writeXlsbBytes`'s counterpart for this is the `unsupported` option.

   *   are listed under `diagnostics.cachedOnlyFormulas`. Choose it to extract numbers from a large workbook without
   *   paying for token decoding, or when a computed value from Excel is worth more than an expression from this
   *   library. Writing such a read back therefore emits literals, and the fidelity report says so.
   * - `"error"` throws {@link XlsbFormulaDecodeError} on the first expression it cannot decode. Choose it when a
   *   dropped formula is a corrupt result rather than a degraded one — a pipeline recalculating the workbook gets a
   *   failure it can act on instead of a silently constant cell.

/**
 * Paths this *reader* parses into the model, so preserving them as well would describe one thing twice.
 *
 * The distinction that matters — and that a first attempt at this got wrong — is between "a writer here can
 * author this part" and "this reader turned it into model state". Only the second belongs here:
 *
 * - **Comments and threaded comments** are parsed (`readCommentsPart`, the threaded-comments xform), so the next
 *   write composes them from the model. Keeping the original too produced a package with both `comments1.xml`
 *   and `comments1.bin`, with the sheet's relationship pointing at the `.bin` — seventeen example workbooks came
 *   out that way, and the self-check reported it as `rels-type-target-mismatch` rather than as duplication.
 * - **A theme and a pivot table are not**, even though writers here can produce both. An XLSB theme is preserved
 *   verbatim and the built-in one stands down for it; a pivot table read from an XLSB is carried through as
 *   opaque parts because the binary cache is kept rather than rebuilt. Excluding them broke exactly the tests
 *   that exist to pin those guarantees, which is the right outcome for a rule applied too widely.
 *
 * Everything else — `xl/media/*`, VML, `docProps/custom.xml`, a VBA project, printer settings — passes through
 * because nothing reads it either.
