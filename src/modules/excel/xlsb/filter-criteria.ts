/**
 * AutoFilter *criteria* — the records nested inside `BrtBeginAFilter`…`BrtEndAFilter`.
 *
 * The range alone is `encodeAutoFilter` in `filter.ts`; this is what makes an applied filter show the rows
 * it was applied to. The two are separate because the model keeps them separate: `autoFilter` is a range
 * string, while the criteria arrive as the **raw XML** the XLSX reader preserved on `autoFilterCriteria`.
 *
 * **The XML is the input on purpose, and this is the whole reason the feature became reachable.** There is
 * no public setter for a criterion — it only ever arrives from a read — and the XLSX writer replays that XML
 * back verbatim, which is what makes an XLSX round trip byte-exact. Introducing a structured model in
 * `core/` to feed this would have meant the XLSX writer re-serialising from that model instead, trading the
 * fidelity of the format that already works for the sake of the one that did not. Parsing here costs the
 * working path nothing.
 *
 * **The record order is not guessed.** MS-XLSB section 3.4 is a byte-level worked example of exactly this
 * sequence — `BrtBeginAFilter`, `BrtBeginFilterColumn`, `BrtBeginCustomFilters`, `BrtCustomFilter`, and the
 * matching ends — which is the authority that does not exist for pivot tables. Each layout comes from its
 * own record page.
