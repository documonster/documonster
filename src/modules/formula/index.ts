 * Public entry for the documonster formula engine.
 *
 * **Functional, zero-side-effect** is the only evaluation style:
 * ```ts
 * import { Formula } from "documonster/formula";
 * Formula.calculate(workbook);
 * ```
 * Perfect tree-shaking: unused exports are dropped, no module initialisation
 * runs, and there is **no install / registration step** — every export is used
 * directly. Bundles that import only `Formula.tokenize` / `Formula.parse` never
 * pull the evaluator or function registry in; the evaluator is reached solely
 * through `Formula.calculate`, so consumers who never call it never pay for it.
 *
 * For PDF export recalculation, pass `Formula.calculate` to
 * `Pdf.fromExcel(wb, { recalculate: Formula.calculate })`.
