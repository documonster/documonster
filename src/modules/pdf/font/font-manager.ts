/**
 * Font manager for PDF generation.
 *
 * Manages three kinds of fonts:
 * 1. **Standard Type1 fonts** (Helvetica, Times, Courier) — always available,
 *    used for Latin text (WinAnsi repertoire) when no embedded font is provided.
 * 2. **Embedded TrueType fonts** — user-provided .ttf files for broader
 *    Unicode glyph coverage (for example CJK and Cyrillic). This does not add
 *    OpenType shaping, bidi reordering, or color-emoji rendering.
 * 3. **Type3 fallback fonts** — auto-generated vector-drawn glyphs for
 *    Unicode characters outside WinAnsi when no embedded font is provided.
 *
 * When an embedded font is registered, ALL text uses the embedded font.
 * When no embedded font is provided, the system uses Type1 for WinAnsi
 * characters and Type3 for everything else.
 *
 * The manager tracks which Unicode code points are used so the font embedder
 * and Type3 builder can create minimal subsets when writing the PDF.
