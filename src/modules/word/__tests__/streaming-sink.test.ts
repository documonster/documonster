 * The comparison has to be on content, not on size. The previous version of this
 * test asserted the two packages had the same total byte length, which fails ~60%
 * of the time when the two builds straddle a clock second: `docProps/core.xml`
 * embeds `new Date()` at second resolution (`word/writer/parts-writer.ts`), and
 * the *digits* of that timestamp change how well the part deflates — measured at
 * 257, 258 and 259 bytes across one minute of timestamps.
 *
 * Comparing per-entry lengths instead would fix the flake and give up the test:
 * two documents differing in every character but not in length would pass. So the
 * entries are decompressed and compared byte for byte, with the timestamps inside
 * `core.xml` — and only the timestamps — normalised away.
