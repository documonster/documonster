/**
 * DOCX Module - Streaming Writer
 *
 * A DOCX generator that serializes body content incrementally and pushes it
 * through a streaming compression pipeline. Uses the same streaming ZIP
 * infrastructure as the Excel module:
 *
 * - `Zip` (StreamingZip) — streams ZIP entries to output
 * - `ZipDeflate` — per-entry deflate compression
 * - `StreamBuf` — event-driven pipe from XML to ZIP
 * - `StringBuf` — efficient XML string builder with buffer reuse
 *
 * Data flow with sink (true end-to-end streaming):
 * ```
 * add(paragraph) → XML → StreamBuf → ZipDeflate → Zip
 *                                                     ↓ (per-chunk callback)
 *                                            await SinkAdapter.write(chunk)
 *                                                     ↓
 *                                           user-supplied WritableStream /
 *                                           Node Writable / duck-typed sink
 * ```
 *
 * Memory profile:
 *   - Body model is never retained: each element is serialised and
 *     compressed as it arrives, so peak per-element memory is
 *     O(largest_single_element).
 *   - When `options.sink` is provided, compressed bytes are pushed
 *     into the sink as soon as they are produced (with backpressure
 *     awaited via {@link SinkAdapter}). Total writer-side memory then
 *     stays O(largest_part) regardless of final DOCX size.
 *   - When `options.sink` is omitted, compressed bytes accumulate in
 *     `_outputChunks` and `finalize()` returns the assembled
 *     `Uint8Array`. Total memory is O(compressed_docx_size).
