 * - `palette` — data. A pie slice, a Gantt bar, a Sankey ribbon, a git lane. These are
 *   deliberately *not* `nodeFill`: a bar is a value, not a box, and colouring it from the
 *   node token would make a chart change colour when a flowchart's boxes were restyled.
 * - `paletteText` — words drawn *on* a palette colour, which need to contrast with it
