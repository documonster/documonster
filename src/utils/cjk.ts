/**
 * Line-breaking for East Asian text.
 *
 * Every wrapping loop in this repository was written for a script that separates
 * its words with spaces, and each one independently did the same thing:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const words = line.split(/\s+/);   // or /(\s+)/, or a manual space/hyphen scan
 * ```
 *
 * Chinese, Japanese and Korean do not put spaces between words, so a CJK
 * paragraph comes out of that as a *single* token. The consequences were not
 * cosmetic:
 *
 * - An Excel cell with `wrapText: true` reported **one** line no matter how long
 *   the text was, so `autoFitRows` left the row at a single line's height and
 *   Excel clipped the content.
 * - The same text in a PDF table overflowed its cell and never wrapped.
 * - Chart and diagram labels never wrapped.
 * - A Word paragraph became one unbreakable atom, so mixed Chinese/English text
 *   pushed the whole run to the next line and left a hole at the end of the
 *   previous one.
 *
 * This module owns the one rule those callers were missing, and it lives at
 * Layer 0 because all four of them (`excel`, `pdf`, `draw`, `word`) need it and
 * no two of them may import each other.
 *
 * ## Scope: a deliberate subset of UAX #14
 *
 * The Unicode line-breaking algorithm is a pair-table over 40-odd classes. What
 * these callers need is much smaller, and pretending otherwise would be a large
 * amount of machinery producing the same answer:
 *
 * - **A break is allowed between two adjacent ideographs.** That single rule is
 *   what makes CJK wrap at all, and it is the whole fix for the bugs above.
 * - **Kinsoku (禁則) is honoured**: a closing bracket or a full stop may not
 *   begin a line, and an opening bracket may not end one. Without this, wrapping
 *   CJK is worse than not wrapping it — a line starting with `。` or `）` is
 *   immediately visible as broken typesetting, which is why Word, InDesign and
 *   every browser implement it.
 * - Latin behaviour is preserved exactly: break after a space or a hyphen, never
 *   inside a word.
 *
 * Not attempted: hyphenation dictionaries, Thai/Khmer/Lao word segmentation
 * (which needs a dictionary, not a table), and Korean word-level breaking
 * (Hangul is treated as breakable per syllable, which is what browsers do by
 * default for `word-break: normal` on Hangul without spaces).
 *
 * ## The design that makes kinsoku free
 *
 * {@link segmentForWrap} returns the pieces a line may be assembled from, and
 * **glues a prohibited character to the neighbour it must stay with**. So
 * `甲（乙）丙` segments as `["甲", "（乙）", "丙"]`, not as four characters.
 *
 * That matters because it means every existing "accumulate width per token,
 * flush when it overflows" loop gets kinsoku without changing its logic — the
 * prohibition is expressed in the token boundaries rather than as a rule the
 * caller has to remember. Callers that need the raw opportunities instead (the
 * Word layout engine, which measures per atom) can use
 * {@link canBreakBetween} directly.
