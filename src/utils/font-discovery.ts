/**
 * System font discovery: find an installed face that can draw a given text.
 *
 * Searches the platform's font directories for a TrueType font (.ttf or .ttc)
 * covering a set of code points, preferring a face whose regional glyph
 * conventions match the language being written.
 *
 * This is a Node.js-only feature — browser environments do not have
 * file system access and must always provide fonts explicitly.
 *
 * ## Why this is at Layer 0
 *
 * It was written for the PDF embedder and lived in `pdf/font/system-fonts.ts`,
 * which meant `draw` could not reach it: `pdf` is Layer 5 and `draw` is Layer 1.
 * The rasteriser therefore had its own idea of how to find a font — a hardcoded
 * list of five Latin filenames per platform, one face, no fallback — and a PNG of
 * a Chinese label came out **blank** while the PDF of the same drawing embedded
 * `Songti SC` and rendered correctly. Nothing reported it: a missing glyph just
 * advanced the pen.
 *
 * Discovery is not cheap or simple enough to have two of. On this machine it
 * enumerates 853 faces across 1.5 GB of font files, and everything below —
 * the lazy candidate bytes, the path index, the per-face metadata cache, the
 * unusable-face set, the single read buffer — exists because a naive version
 * exhausted a 4 GB heap or re-read hundreds of megabytes per call. So it sits at
 * the one layer both renderers can reach, on top of `./font-ttf`.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not decided here
 *
 * Whether a code point *needs* a real face is the caller's policy, passed as
 * {@link RequiresFacePredicate}. PDF can draw an arrow or a checkbox with a Type3
 * glyph, so those must not disqualify a Chinese font; the rasteriser has no such
 * fallback, so for it everything counts. Baking either answer in would make the
 * other one wrong — see the `essential` comment in {@link findSystemFontForCodePoints}
 * for what that cost when it was baked in.
 *
 * .ttc (TrueType Collection) files are supported, and are expanded to one
 * candidate per face: the faces in a collection differ in both coverage and
 * regional glyph conventions, so face 0 is not automatically the one worth
 * having.
 *
 * Discovery runs as an internal generator so selection can stop at the first face
 * that answers; {@link discoverSystemFontCandidates} materialises the whole list
 * for tests and for callers enumerating deliberately.
 *
 * Neither is cached — a snapshot holds every font file's bytes. What *is* cached is
 * the metadata that costs I/O rather than memory: the path index, each file's face
 * count, each face's family and weight, and the faces already proven unparseable.
 *
 * Auto-embed callers should not iterate themselves: use
 * {@link findSystemFontForCodePoints}, which owns the coverage rule so every
 * pipeline picks the same font for the same text.
 *
 * Ordering is a legibility decision, not just a coverage one — see
 * `PREFERRED_FONTS` below.

 * constraining it. Use `embedFonts()` when a face is a requirement.

 * lacks take the same Type3 route; `FontManager.getUncoveredFallbackCodePoints`
 * reports them.
 *
 * **Partial coverage wins over no coverage.** A face that draws most of the text is
 * returned when none draws all of it, because the alternative is not "a better font"
 * but *no* font: every character goes to Type3 and a page of Chinese becomes boxes
 * because of the one emoji no installed face carries. Only a face that covers
