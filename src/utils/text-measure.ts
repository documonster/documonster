 * and the tiered measurement around them were reachable only from `@excel/utils`, which
 * put them out of reach of the drawing engine and of any producer sitting beside it: a
 * diagram lays its boxes out around the text they contain, so a producer that cannot
 * measure text cannot size anything.
 *
 * Nothing here knows about spreadsheets. The Excel-specific measurement — autofit column
 * widths, wrapped line counts, rich text, cell formats — stays in
 * `@excel/utils/text-metrics`, which now calls into this.
 *
 * Three tiers, in order of preference:
 *
 * 1. Real per-glyph advances from an embedded metrics table.
 * 2. Calibri 11pt, whose pixel widths are tabulated exactly because it is Excel's
 *    default and its column arithmetic depends on them.
 * 3. Category averages — lowercase, uppercase, wide — for a face with no table. A
 *    guess, but a bounded one, and better than assuming a monospace grid.
