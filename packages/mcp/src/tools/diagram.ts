/**
 * Mermaid diagram helpers shared by `diagram_render`, `diagram_inspect` and the
 * Markdown fence rendering in `doc_write` / `doc_convert`.
 *
 * Three things live here that no tool should re-derive:
 *
 * 1. **Where the source comes from.** A model supplies a diagram inline, or names
 *    a `.mmd` file, or names a Markdown file with several ` ```mermaid ` fences in
 *    it. All three resolve to the same thing, and fence positions are needed again
 *    later to splice rendered images back into the Markdown.
 * 2. **What "render" means per format.** The diagram is converted to a display
 *    list *once*; SVG, PNG and PDF are three readings of that one list. Doing it
 *    any other way is how three backends come to disagree about one picture.
 * 3. **What the parser actually saw.** A model cannot look at the output, so the
 *    only way it can verify a diagram is a structural read-back. That is
 *    {@link describeDiagram}, and it is the reason `diagram_inspect` exists.
 *
 * Theme presets are deliberately *this package's* own, not a claim of parity with
 * Mermaid's named themes: only `default` is token-for-token Mermaid (the library
 * reproduces Mermaid's `base` exactly). `themeOverrides` exposes every colour
 * token, so nothing is reachable through the library that is not reachable here.
