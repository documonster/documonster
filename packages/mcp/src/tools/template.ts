/**
 * `template_inspect` and `template_fill` — Word templating.
 *
 * The best-shaped pair of tools in this server, because the model's job is
 * reduced to supplying data:
 *
 *   template_inspect  →  "this template wants client.name, items[], signature"
 *   template_fill     →  here is that data as JSON
 *
 * `listTemplateTags` is effectively a self-describing schema, so nothing about
 * the document's internals has to enter the model's context, and the styling,
 * fonts, headers and numbering are whatever the template author set — the model
 * cannot break them. Compared with generating a document from scratch, the
 * surface for error is an order of magnitude smaller.
