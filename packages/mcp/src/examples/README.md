# Examples

Most of these produce a **test environment** rather than a document: a workspace of
deliberately awkward files plus the client configuration to point an AI assistant at
it.

That difference is the point. The test suite can prove the tools work; it cannot
prove a _model_ uses them correctly from plain language. Only a real client can.

`diagram-paging.ts` is the exception — it produces a document, because the two
decisions it demonstrates are only visible on a page.

## Files

| File                 | Purpose                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `setup-workspace.ts` | Builds `tmp/mcp-examples/workspace/` and prints ready-to-paste client config                          |
| `probe-tools.ts`     | Drives the real executable over stdio and exercises all six tools — run this before blaming the model |
| `prompts.md`         | Natural-language prompts to try in a client, with what a good and a bad run look like                 |
| `diagram-paging.ts`  | How a diagram is fitted to the text column and cut across pages, with the numbers for each case       |

## Use

```bash
# 1. Build the workspace and print the client configuration
node src/examples/setup-workspace.ts

# 2. Confirm the server itself is healthy (needs a build)
pnpm build
node src/examples/probe-tools.ts

# 3. Paste the printed config into your client, restart it,
#    then work through prompts.md
```

Independently of the workspace:

```bash
# How a tall or wide diagram is placed on a page (writes a .docx, no build needed)
node --import @oxc-node/core/register src/examples/diagram-paging.ts
```

## What `diagram-paging.ts` shows

Two decisions that only exist once a diagram has to live on a page.

**Fitting is not the same as being readable.** Word does not shrink an oversized
inline image, it runs it off the paper, so an image has to be scaled to the 468-point
column. Scaling _alone_ is the trap: a 1901-point flowchart drawn at 25% turns its
14pt labels into 3.4pt. The answer is to make the diagram intrinsically narrower and
let it grow downwards, wrapping the cheapest text first — gaps, then edge labels,
then a node's own text last of all.

**A diagram taller than a page is cut, not shrunk.** Shrinking gives back the
legibility the narrowing just bought. The cut has to fall on a row that crosses no
box and no word; a row crossing a _link_ is fine, because the line continues at the
top of the next page like any split figure. Note that a row of entirely background
pixels does not exist in a top-to-bottom flowchart — the links cross every gap — so
the obstacles are read out of the display list instead.

## What the workspace probes

| Fixture                   | Probes                                                          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reports.zip`             | Archive as the entry point; nested paths; selective extraction  |
| `budget.xlsx`             | Multi-sheet, cross-sheet formulas, merged title, number formats |
| `budget.xlsx` → `Eng`     | 340 rows — forces pagination instead of a full read             |
| `budget.xlsx` → `Archive` | An empty sheet, which reports a zero-based dimension            |
| `inventory.csv`           | 5 000 generated rows — reading it all is the wrong move         |
| `june.csv`                | Semicolon-delimited, CRLF, UTF-8 BOM — dialect detection        |
| `export.xlsx`             | Actually a CSV — extension-mismatch detection                   |
| `legacy.doc`              | CFB container — the ambiguous legacy-or-encrypted case          |
| `spec.docx`               | A real Word file with **no tool to read it**, on purpose        |

`invoice-template.docx` is the most interesting one. It contains a
`{{client.abn}}` field that a model is likely to forget — and a missing field is
an error, not a blank. Whether the model reads the error, adds the field and
retries once, or thrashes, is exactly what no unit test can tell you.

## Note

`probe-tools.ts` spawns `dist/cli.js`, exactly as a client does, so it catches
packaging problems (missing shebang, wrong `bin` path, stray writes to stdout)
that in-process tests cannot. Everything it writes goes under
`tmp/mcp-examples/`, which is gitignored.
