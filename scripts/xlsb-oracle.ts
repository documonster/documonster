/**
 * The XLSB oracle: a corpus of workbooks written twice, once by this library and once by Excel.
 *
 * **Why this exists.** Everything in `pnpm check` establishes that this library agrees with itself. None of it
 * establishes that Excel will open the result, and for XLSB those turned out to be very different properties:
 * a pivot table whose every record matched `[MS-XLSB]` field for field, whose lengths were right, whose
 * cross-part invariants held and which survived three read-write generations, was refused outright. Fourteen
 * separate defects were behind it, and the ones that mattered most were invisible from inside — a record that
 * must carry no payload, a flag bit two positions off, a layout the XML form is allowed to leave to Excel and
 * the binary form is not.
 *
 * The way each of those was finally found was the same: obtain a file Excel wrote for the same content and
 * read the difference. This script makes that repeatable.
 *
 * **The loop.**
 *
 * ```
 * pnpm oracle:generate          # writes tmp/xlsb-oracle/in/*.xlsx
 *                               # → open each in Excel, Save As "Excel Binary Workbook (*.xlsb)"
 *                               #   into tmp/xlsb-oracle/ref/, keeping the base name
 * pnpm oracle:diff              # rebuilds each workbook as XLSB and reports every difference
 * ```
 *
 * Both commands run under `node --import @oxc-node/core/register`, not plain `node`: this file imports the
 * library through the same tsconfig `paths` aliases the source uses, and Node's own type stripping does not
 * resolve those.
 *
 * The manual step is the point: Excel is the only oracle available, and it is not scriptable here. So this is
 * deliberately **not** wired into `pnpm check` — it is a tool for the person doing the work, and its output is
 * a list of leads, not a pass or a fail.
 *
 * **Read the output with the asymmetry in mind.** A difference is not automatically a defect. Excel records
 * the window geometry it happened to have, the user's name, a refresh timestamp, and an identifier or two it
 * chose freely; it also writes informational records this library has no reason to emit. Those are filtered
 * (see `BENIGN`), and the filter is a claim that can be wrong — when in doubt, look at the raw record.
 *
 * **This is a diagnostic, not a CI gate, and it exits 0 with differences on purpose.**
 *
 * The reference files are produced by a person opening each input in Excel and choosing "Save As", so they cannot exist
 * on a clean runner — `tmp/` is gitignored. And a difference is not a failure: every one needs a human to decide whether
 * it is a defect or one of Excel's freedoms, which is what `BENIGN` records. Wiring this into CI would either fail on the
 * missing references or fail on differences already judged benign.
 *
 * What *is* automated from the same evidence: `verify:xlsb-corpus` (semantic checks over real files, including a content
 * fingerprint held across containers) and `verify:libreoffice` (a third-party reader on every package this library
 * writes). Those run without a human in the loop; this does not.
 *
 * **Scope: record streams only.** `records()` walks the `.bin` parts and nothing else, so relationship targets and types,
 * `[Content_Types].xml`, and the drawing and chart XML are outside this comparison. That is a real limit and it is
 * covered elsewhere rather than here: `rewrite-structure.node.test.ts` asserts the package invariants (one declaration
 * per part, one relationship per declared sheet, no dangling `Override`), `verify:libreoffice` catches a package a third
 * party refuses, and the two duplicated-part defects that motivated those checks were found by LibreOffice — not by
 * this.
 *
 * What the loop cannot tell you:
 *
 * - Whether a feature this library writes *only* in XLSB is right, since there is no XLSX for Excel to
 *   convert. Every workbook below is therefore built through the same public API used for both formats.
 * - Anything about a record Excel merely copied from the XLSX it was given. Where this library's XLSX writer
 *   states something unconditionally — `customWidth="1"` on every `<col>`, say — Excel's XLSB repeats it, and
 *   the diff is then a mirror rather than an authority.
 * - Rule-for-rule detail in a case where some items were dropped. The alignment is a longest-common-subsequence
 *   over record names, so three missing conditional-formatting rules make the surrounding rules pair up with
 *   the wrong counterparts. Fix the omission first, then read the bytes.
