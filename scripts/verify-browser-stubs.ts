/**
 * The published tree must never reach a Node-only module that has a browser variant
 * except through a `#platform/*` specifier.
 *
 * A `*.browser.ts` file exists because its sibling cannot work — or should not ship —
 * in a browser. Selecting between them is a *resolution* concern: `link-platform-variants.ts`
 * rewrites every such import to `#platform/<path>`, and the manifest's `imports` field maps
 * that to the Node or browser file per condition. A relative specifier left behind is a
 * silent hole: the browser condition cannot fire for it, so a browser consumer receives the
 * Node module and nothing fails.
 *
 * That is what this checks, and why it checks the artifact rather than the source: the source
 * deliberately imports the Node name (`@utils/fs`), and the rewrite happens on the way out.
 *
 * The concrete failure that prompted it: `utils/font-discovery.ts` and
 * `draw/raster/system-raster-font.ts` exist only to read font files off a disk, and
 * each carries a table of per-platform paths — the curated CJK families
 * (`/System/Library/Fonts/Supplemental`, `msyh.ttc`, `PingFang SC`, several hundred
 * more) and the Arial / Helvetica / DejaVu fallbacks. Both shipped to browsers. A
 * `typeof process === "undefined"` guard makes such a module *inert*, not absent: a
 * bundler has to keep every string a reachable module might use. Adding the two
 * stubs took 13.7 kB (minified) off the pdf bundle and 5.2 kB off excel.
 *
 * Why not assert on the module graph in `treeshake-verify`: those scenarios inspect
 * the entry chunk, so a module that lands in a lazily-split chunk passes while
 * still shipping. Why not grep the output for `/System/Library/Fonts`: that only
 * catches the tables that exist today. The invariant is structural — a shipped file
 * importing a Node module that has a browser variant — so it is checked as such,
 * and covers `fs`, `crypto`, `stream` and every other pair as a side effect.
 *
 * Declarations are checked alongside the JavaScript. Skipping them once left the
 * browser type graph pointing at Node variants (csv's parser typed `Transform` from
 * the Node `stream` entry while the JS loaded the browser one), so browser consumers
 * needed `@types/node`. `pnpm build:verify:browser` guards the same property from the
 * other direction, by type-checking the browser declarations with `--customConditions
 * browser` and no Node types available.
