/**
 * Hands every workbook this repository produces to LibreOffice, and asks whether an independent implementation can read
 * it.
 *
 * **Why a third reader exists at all.** Every other check here is judged by one of three parties, and each has a gap
 * the others do not fill:
 *
 * - This library's own reader, through a round trip. Cheap, runs on everything — and structurally unable to catch a
 *   reader and a writer that share one wrong assumption, which is where most of this codec's real defects have come
 *   from. A round trip through a shared mistake is perfect.
 * - A byte comparison against files Excel itself saved (`scripts/xlsb-oracle.ts`). The strongest automated signal
 *   available, but it needs a human to produce each reference file, so it covers fifteen cases.
 * - A person opening the file in Excel. The only authority that counts, and the reason several crash-level defects
 *   here were found at all. It does not scale: most of the files this repository writes have never been opened.
 *
 * LibreOffice is the only judge that is both independent of this codebase and cheap enough to point at all of them.
 *
 * **What a pass does not mean.** LibreOffice is markedly more permissive than Excel. This is not a guess: an array
 * formula written without a `PtgExp` forwarding record for every cell in its range made *Excel terminate its own
 * process*, while this library's 19,900 tests and every third-party-format check passed. So:
 *
 * - a failure here is a strong signal — the file is broken;
 * - a pass here is a weak one — it says nothing about whether Excel will accept it.
 *
 * Read this gate as a screen for gross structural damage across files nobody has opened, and not as a substitute for
 * opening them.
 *
 * **What "converted successfully" is worth, precisely.** Three things are checked: a zero exit, an output file that is
 * not empty, and no repair or error in LibreOffice's diagnostics. The middle one is a floor rather than a verdict, and it
 * was worth measuring how low: a workbook whose shared-string table is truncated to garbage converts to a **one-byte**
 * CSV while an intact single-cell workbook converts to two, and LibreOffice reports nothing either way. So a package can
 * lose all of its content and pass — which is why the corpus checks compare *content* (`verify:xlsb-corpus` derives a
 * fingerprint per fixture and holds it across containers) and this gate is about structure.
 *
 * The repair scan is applied to the diagnostics and **not** to the `convert … -> … using filter …` line LibreOffice
 * echoes on success. That line contains the input path, so a fixture directory named `lo-repair-test` failed this check
 * on the strength of its own name — a gate reporting on itself.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```
 * pnpm verify:libreoffice              # skips loudly when LibreOffice is absent
 * pnpm verify:libreoffice --require    # absence is a failure — what CI passes
 * pnpm verify:libreoffice --filter pivot
 * ```
 *
 * `--require` is the whole design. A gate that skips silently when its dependency is missing is a gate that is green
 * forever: it would skip on every developer machine, and skip again the day the CI install breaks, reporting success
 * both times. With `--require`, "could not be verified" and "was verified" cannot be confused.

 * Files that are inputs or references rather than this library's output.
 *
 * **Whole directories, and only whole directories.** `tmp/xlsb-oracle/` holds the inputs `pnpm oracle:generate` writes
 * and, in `ref/`, the workbooks a person saved out of Excel — which is where a manual "Save As" belongs, by the contract
 * `scripts/xlsb-oracle.ts` states. `tmp/xlsb-corpus/` holds third-party fixtures. Checking either tells you about Excel
 * or about the fixture, not about this writer.
 *
 * Everything else under `tmp/` is this library's output and is checked. **That replaced a rule based on the file's
 * name**, and the replacement is the point rather than a simplification: this gate also used to skip
 * `tmp/excel-examples/*<digit>.xls[bx]`, on the theory that a trailing digit marked a copy Excel had saved beside the
 * original. Measured against a clean `pnpm verify:examples`, every one of the 26 files it dropped had been written by
 * `protection-spin-count.ts`, which numbers its outputs `-0` … `-12` — 13 `.xlsb` and 13 `.xlsx`, one file in seven,
 * silently unchecked with no true positive to show for it. It had already misfired once before, on
 * `tmp/xlsb-bisect/g2-array-4x1.xlsb`, and the response then was to narrow it to one directory; that only moved the
 * hole into the directory where most of the output lands. A name cannot answer "who wrote this" — and neither can the
 * file, since `app-xform.ts` writes `<Application>Microsoft Excel</Application>` on purpose — so the question is
 * answered by where the file is put, which is the one part of it a contract can pin.
 *
 * One consequence is deliberate: a reference file left in `tmp/excel-examples/` is now checked as though this library
 * had written it. `sales-dashboard1.xlsb` converts to a **one-byte** CSV, because Excel stored the sheet with its pivots
 * collapsed — it passes, since the check below is "not empty" rather than a verdict on content. A reference that would
 * fail belongs in `ref/` anyway.
