/**
 * Fetch the pinned XLSB reference corpus into the local cache.
 *
 * Run: `pnpm corpus:xlsb`
 *
 * The files are other projects' test fixtures, pinned by commit and SHA-256 in
 * `xlsb/corpus/manifest.ts`. They are not committed — their licensing is not ours to assume and they
 * do not belong in the published package — so this downloads them into the gitignored `tmp/` cache
 * that `real-world-corpus.node.test.ts` reads.
 *
 * **A digest mismatch fails.** Upstream is free to change a fixture; this module is not free to keep
 * asserting the old bytes while reading the new ones. Re-pinning is a deliberate edit to the manifest,
 * with the layout claims re-checked, rather than something a download quietly does for you.
 *
 * Already-cached files are verified and skipped, so a second run costs no network.
